<h3 class="chap">AMBOYNA.</h3>

<p>The tragedy of Amboyna, as it was justly termed by the English
of the seventeenth century, was of itself too dreadful to be
heightened by the mimic horrors of the stage. The reader may
be reminded, that by three several treaties in the years 1613, 1615,
and 1619, it was agreed betwixt England and Holland, that the
English should enjoy one-third of the trade of the spice islands.
For this purpose, factories were established on behalf of the English
East India Company at the Molucca Islands, at Banda, and
at Amboyna. At the latter island the Dutch had a castle, with
a garrison, both of Europeans and natives. It has been always
remarked, that the Dutchman, in his eastern settlements, loses
the mercantile probity of his European character, while he retains
its cold-blooded phlegm and avaricious selfishness. Of this the Amboyna
government gave a notable proof. About the 11th of Feb.
1622, old stile, under pretence of a plot laid between the English
of the factory and some Japanese soldiers to seize the castle, the former
were arrested by the Dutch, and subjected to the most horrible
tortures, to extort confession of their pretended guilt. Upon some
they poured water into a cloth previously secured round their
necks and shoulders, until suffocation ensued; others were tortured
with lighted matches, and torches applied to the most tender
and sensible parts of the body. But I will not pollute my page
with this monstrous and disgusting detail. Upon confessions, inconsistent
with each other, with common sense and ordinary probability,
extorted also by torments of the mind or body, or both,
Captain Gabriel Towerson, and nine other English merchants of
consideration, were executed; and, to add insult to atrocity, the
bloody cloth, on which Towerson kneeled at his death, was put
down to the account of the English Company. The reader may
find the whole history in the second volume of Purchas's "Pilgrim."
The news of this horrible massacre reached King James, while he
was negociating with the Dutch concerning the assistance which
they then implored against the Spaniards; and the affairs of his son-in-law,
the Elector Palatine, appeared to render an union with Holland
so peremptorily necessary, that the massacre of Amboyna
was allowed to remain unrevenged.</p>

<p>But the Dutch war, which was declared in 1672, the object
of which seems to have been the annihilation of the United
Provinces as an independent state, a century sooner than Providence
had decreed that calamitous event, met with great opposition
in England, and every engine was put to work to satisfy the people
of the truth of the Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury's averment, that
<a class="pgnm" id="page_004" name="page_004"></a>
the "States of Holland were England's eternal enemies, both by interest
and inclination." Dryden, with the avowed intention of exasperating
the nation against the Dutch, assumed from choice, or
by command, the unpromising subject of the Amboyna massacre
as the foundation of the following play. Exclusive of the horrible
nature of the subject, the colours are laid on too thick to produce
the desired effect. The monstrous caricatures, which are exhibited
as just paintings of the Dutch character, unrelieved even by
the grandeur of wickedness, and degraded into actual brutality,
must have produced disgust, instead of an animated hatred and
detestation. For the horrible spectacle of tortures and mangled
limbs exhibited on the stage, the author might plead the custom
of his age. A stage direction in Ravenscroft's alteration of "Titus
Andronicus," bears, "A curtain drawn, discovers the heads
and hands of Demetrius and Chiron hanging up against the wall;
their bodies in chairs, in bloody linen." And in an interlude,
called the "Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru," written by D'Avenant,
"a doleful pavin is played to prepare the change of the
scene, which represents a dark prison at a great distance; and
farther to the view are discerned racks and other engines of torment,
with which the Spaniards are tormenting the natives and English
mariners, who may be supposed to be lately landed there to discover
the coast. Two Spaniards are likewise discovered sitting in their
cloaks, and appearing more solemn in ruffs, with rapiers and daggers
by their sides; the one turning a spit, while the other is basting
an Indian prince, who is roasted at an artificial fire<a class="ftnt" href="#Amboy_1-1">[1]</a>." The
rape of Isabinda is stated by Langbaine to have been borrowed
from a novel in the Decamerone of Cinthio Giraldi.</p>

<p>This play is beneath criticism; and I can hardly hesitate to
term it the worst production Dryden ever wrote. It was acted
and printed in 1673.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
THE
LORD CLIFFORD
OF
CHUDLEIGH<a class="ftnt" href="#Amboy_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>


<p class="smcap noind">My Lord,</p>

<p>After so many favours, and those so great, conferred
on me by your lordship these many years,&mdash;which
I may call more properly one continued act
of your generosity and goodness,&mdash;I know not whether
<a class="pgnm" id="page_006" name="page_006"></a>
I should appear either more ungrateful in my
silence, or more extravagantly vain in my endeavours
to acknowledge them: For, since all acknowledgements
bear a face of payment, it may be
thought, that I have flattered myself into an opinion
of being able to return some part of my obligements
to you;&mdash;the just despair of which attempt,
and the due veneration I have for his person, to
whom I must address, have almost driven me to receive
only with a profound submission the effects of
that virtue, which is never to be comprehended but
by admiration; and the greatest note of admiration
is silence. It is that noble passion, to which
poets raise their audience in highest subjects, and
they have then gained over them the greatest victory,
when they are ravished into a pleasure which
is not to be expressed by words. To this pitch,
my lord, the sense of my gratitude had almost raised
me: to receive your favours, as the Jews of old
received their law, with a mute wonder; to think,
that the loudness of acclamation was only the praise
of men to men, and that the secret homage of the
soul was a greater mark of reverence, than an outward
ceremonious joy, which might be counterfeit,
and must be irreverent in its tumult. Neither, my
lord, have I a particular right to pay you my acknowledgements:
You have been a good so universal,
that almost every man in the three nations may
think me injurious to his propriety, that I invade
your praises, in undertaking to celebrate them alone;
and that I have assumed to myself a patron, who
was no more to be circumscribed than the sun and
elements, which are of public benefit to human
kind.</p>

<p>As it was much in your power to oblige all who
could pretend to merit from the public, so it was
more in your nature and inclination. If any went
<a class="pgnm" id="page_007" name="page_007"></a>
ill-satisfied from the treasury, while it was in your
lordship's management, it proclaimed the want of
desert, and not of friends: You distributed your
master's favour with so equal hands, that justice
herself could not have held the scales more even;
but with that natural propensity to do good, that
had that treasure been your own, your inclination
to bounty must have ruined you. No man attended
to be denied: No man bribed for expedition:
Want and desert were pleas sufficient. By your
own integrity, and your prudent choice of those
whom you employed, the king gave all that he intended;
and gratuities to his officers made not vain
his bounty. This, my lord, you were in your public
capacity of high treasurer, to which you ascended
by such degrees, that your royal master saw
your virtues still growing to his favours, faster
than they could rise to you. Both at home and
abroad, with your sword and with your counsel,
you have served him with unbiassed honour, and
unshaken resolution; making his greatness, and the
true interest of your country, the standard and measure
of your actions. Fortune may desert the wise
and brave, but true virtue never will forsake itself<a class="ftnt" href="#Amboy_2-2">[2]</a>.
It is the interest of the world, that virtuous men
should attain to greatness, because it gives them the
power of doing good: But when, by the iniquity of
the times, they are brought to that extremity, that
they must either quit their virtue or their fortune,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_008" name="page_008"></a>
they owe themselves so much, as to retire to the
private exercise of their honour;&mdash;to be great within,
and by the constancy of their resolutions, to
teach the inferior world how they ought to judge
of such principles, which are asserted with so generous
and so unconstrained a trial.</p>

<p>But this voluntary neglect of honours has been of
rare example in the world<a class="ftnt" href="#Amboy_2-3">[3]</a>: Few men have frowned
first upon fortune, and precipitated themselves
from the top of her wheel, before they felt at least
the declination of it. We read not of many emperors
like Dioclesian and Charles the Fifth, who
have preferred a garden and a cloister before a
crowd of followers, and the troublesome glory of an
active life, which robs the possessor of his rest and
quiet, to secure the safety and happiness of others.
Seneca, with the help of his philosophy, could never
attain to that pitch of virtue: He only endeavoured
to prevent his fall by descending first, and offered
to resign that wealth which he knew he could no
longer hold; he would only have made a present
to his master of what he foresaw would become his
prey; he strove to avoid the jealousy of a tyrant,&mdash;you
dismissed yourself from the attendance and privacy
of a gracious king. Our age has afforded us
many examples of a contrary nature; but your lordship
is the only one of this. It is easy to discover
in all governments, those who wait so close on fortune,
that they are never to be shaken off at any
turn: Such who seem to have taken up a resolution
of being great; to continue their stations on the
theatre of business; to change with the scene, and
shift the vizard for another part&mdash;these men condemn
<a class="pgnm" id="page_009" name="page_009"></a>
in their discourses that virtue which they
dare not practise: But the sober part of this present
age, and impartial posterity, will do right, both to
your lordship and to them: And, when they read
on what accounts, and with how much magnanimity,
you quitted those honours, to which the highest
ambition of an English subject could aspire, will
apply to you, with much more reason, what the
historian said of a Roman emperor, "<i>Multi diutius
imperium tenuerunt; nemo fortius reliquit.</i>"</p>

<p>To this retirement of your lordship, I wish I
could bring a better entertainment than this play;
which, though it succeeded on the stage, will scarcely
bear a serious perusal; it being contrived and
written in a month, the subject barren, the persons
low, and the writing not heightened with many laboured
scenes. The consideration of these defects
ought to have prescribed more modesty to the author,
than to have presented it to that person in
the world for whom he has the greatest honour,
and of whose patronage the best of his endeavours
had been unworthy: But I had not satisfied myself
in staying longer, and could never have paid the
debt with a much better play. As it is, the meanness
of it will shew; at least, that I pretend not by
it to make any manner of return for your favours;
and that I only give you a new occasion of exercising
your goodness to me, in pardoning the failings
and imperfections of,</p>

<li><a id="Amboy_2-1" name="Amboy_2-1"></a>Sir Thomas Clifford, just then created Lord Clifford of Chudleigh,
and appointed Lord High Treasurer, was one of the six ministers,
the initials of whose names furnished the word <i>Cabal</i>, by
which their junto was distinguished. He was the most virtuous
and honest of the junto, but a Catholic; and, what was then synonymous,
a warm advocate for arbitrary power. He is said to
have won his promotion by advising the desperate measure of shutting
the Exchequer in 1671, the hint of which he is said to have
stolen from Shaftesbury. This piece may have been undertaken
by his command; for, even at the very time of the triple alliance,
he is reported to have said, "For all this, we must have another
Dutch war." Upon the defection of Lord Shaftesbury from the
court party, and the passing of the test act, Lord Clifford resigned
his office, retired to the country, and died in September 1673,
shortly after receiving this dedication.</li>

survived the temporary occasion. Even in a little satirical effusion,
he tells us,

termed a Satire against the Dutch.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>As needy gallants in the scriveners' hands,</p>
<p>Court the rich knave that gripes their mortgaged lands,</p>
<p>The first fat buck of all the season's sent,</p>
<p>And keeper takes no fee in compliment:</p>
<p>The dotage of some Englishmen is such</p>
<p>To fawn on those who ruin them&mdash;the Dutch.</p>
<p>They shall have all, rather than make a war</p>
<p>With those who of the same religion are.</p>
<p>The Straits, the Guinea trade, the herrings too,</p>
<p>Nay, to keep friendship, they shall pickle you.</p>
<p>Some are resolved not to find out the cheat,</p>
<p>But, cuckold like, love him who does the feat:</p>
<p>What injuries soe'er upon us fall,</p>
<p>Yet, still, The same religion, answers all:</p>
<p>Religion wheedled you to civil war,</p>
<p>Drew English blood, and Dutchmen's now would spare:</p>
<p>Be gulled no longer, for you'll find it true,</p>
<p>They have no more religion, faith&mdash;than you;</p>
<p>Interest's the god they worship in their state;</p>
<p>And you, I take it, have not much of that.</p>
<p>Well, monarchies may own religion's name,</p>
<p>But states are atheists in their very frame.</p>
<p>They share a sin, and such proportions fall,</p>
<p>That, like a stink, 'tis nothing to them all.</p>
<p>How they love England, you shall see this day;</p>
<p>No map shews Holland truer than our play:</p>
<p>Their pictures and inscriptions well we know<a class="ftnt" href="#Amboy_3-1">[1]</a>;</p>
<p>We may be bold one medal sure to show.</p>
<p>View then their falsehoods, rapine, cruelty;</p>
<p>And think what once they were, they still would be:</p>
<p>But hope not either language, plot, or art;</p>
<p>'Twas writ in haste, but with an English heart:</p>
<p>And least hope wit; in Dutchmen that would be</p>
<p>As much improper, as would honesty.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Harman</span> Senior, the Governor, the Fiscal,
and <span class="cnm">Van Herring:</span> Guards.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> A happy day to our noble governor.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Morrow, Fiscal.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Did the last ships, which came from
Holland to these parts, bring us no news of moment?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Yes, the best that ever came into Amboyna,
since we set footing here; I mean as to our interest.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> I wonder much my letters then gave me so
short accounts; they only said the Orange party
was grown strong again, since Barnevelt had suffered.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Mine inform me farther, the price of
pepper, and of other spices, was raised of late in
Europe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> I wish that news may hold; but much suspect
it, while the English maintain their factories
among us in Amboyna, or in the neighbouring plantations
of Seran.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_014" name="page_014"></a>
<span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Still I have news that tickles me within;
ha, ha, ha! I'faith it does, and will do you, and all
our countrymen.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Pr'ythee do not torture us, but tell it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Whence comes this news?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> From England.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Is their East India fleet bound outward for
these parts, or cast away, or met at sea by pirates?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Better, much better yet; ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Now am I famished for my part of the
laughter.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Then, my brave governor, if you're a true
Dutchman, I'll make your fat sides heave with the
conceit on't, 'till you're blown like a pair of large
smith's bellows; here, look upon this paper.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> [<span class="sdm">reading.</span>] <i>You may remember we did endamage
the English East-India Company the value of five
hundred thousand pounds, all in one year; a treaty is now
signed, in which the business is ta'en up for fourscore
thousand.</i>&mdash;This is news indeed: would I were upon
the castle-wall, that I might throw my cap into
the sea, and my gold chain after it! this is golden
news, boys.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> This is news would kindle a thousand
bonfires, and make us piss them out again in Rhenish
wine.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Send presently to all our factories, acquaint
them with these blessed tidings: If we can 'scape
so cheap, 'twill be no matter what villanies henceforth
we put in practice.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Hum! why this now gives encouragement
to a certain plot, which I have been long brewing,
against these skellum English. I almost have it here
in pericranio, and 'tis a sound one, 'faith; no less
than to cut all their throats, and seize all their effects
within this island. I warrant you we may
compound again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_015" name="page_015"></a>
<span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Seizing their factories I like well enough,
it has some savour in't; but for this whoreson cutting
of throats, it goes a little against the grain, because
'tis so notoriously known in Christendom, that they
have preserved ours from being cut by the Spaniards.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Hang them, base English starts, let them
e'en take their part of their own old proverb&mdash;Save a
thief from the gallows; they would needs protect
us rebels, and see what comes to themselves.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You're i'the right on't, noble Harman; their
assistance, which was a mercy and a providence to
us, shall be a judgment upon them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> A little favour would do well; though
not that I would stop the current of your wit, or
any other plot, to do them mischief; but they were
first discoverers of this isle, first traded hither, and
showed us the way.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> I grant you that; nay more, that, by composition
made after many long and tedious quarrels,
they were to have a third part of the traffic, we to
build forts, and they to contribute to the charge.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Which we have so increased each year upon
them, we being in power, and therefore judges of
the cost, that we exact whatever we please, still
more than half the charge; and on pretence of their
non-payment, or the least delay, do often stop their
ships, detain their goods, and drag them into prisons,
while our commodities go on before, and still forestall
their markets.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> These, I confess, are pretty tricks, but will not
do our business; we must ourselves be ruined at
long run, if they have any trade here; I know our
charge at length will eat us out: I would not let
these English from this isle have cloves enough to
stick an orange with, not one to throw into their
bottle-ale.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> But to bring this about now, there's the
cunning.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_016" name="page_016"></a>
<span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Let me alone awhile; I have it, as I told you,
here; mean time we must put on a seeming kindness,
call them our benefactors and dear brethren, pipe
them within the danger of our net, and then we'll
draw it o'er them: When they're in, no mercy, that's
my maxim.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Nay, brother, I am not too obstinate
for saving Englishmen, 'twas but a qualm of conscience,
which profit will dispel: I have as true a
Dutch antipathy to England, as the proudest <i>he</i> in
Amsterdam; that's a bold word now.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> We are secure of our superiors there. Well,
they may give the king of Great Britain a verbal
satisfaction, and with submissive fawning promises,
make shew to punish us; but interest is their god
as well as ours. To that almighty, they will sacrifice
a thousand English lives, and break a hundred thousand
oaths, ere they will punish those that make them
rich, and pull their rivals down.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Guns go off within.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Heard you those guns?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Most plainly.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> The sound comes from the port; some ship
arrived salutes the castle, and I hope brings more
good news from Holland.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Guns again.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Now they answer them from the fortress.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Beamont</span> and <span class="cnm">Collins.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Beamont and Collins, English merchants
both; perhaps they'll certify us.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Captain Harman van Spelt, good day to you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Dear, kind Mr Beamont, a thousand and a
thousand good days to you, and all our friends the
English.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Came you from the port, gentlemen?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> We did; and saw arrive, our honest, and our
gallant countryman, brave captain Gabriel Towerson.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Sent to these parts from our employers of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_017" name="page_017"></a>
the East India company in England, as general of
the voyage.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Is the brave Towerson returned?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> The same, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> He shall be nobly welcome. He has already
spent twelve years upon, or near, these rich Molucca
isles, and home returned with honour and great
wealth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> The devil give him joy of both, or I will for
him.<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> He's my particular friend; I lived with him,
both at Tencrate, Tydore, and at Seran.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Did he not leave a mistress in these
parts, a native of this island of Amboyna?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> He did; I think they call her Isabinda, who
received baptism for his sake, before he hence departed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> 'Tis much against the will of all her friends,
she loves your countryman, but they are not disposers
of her person; she's beauteous, rich, and young,
and Towerson well deserves her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I think, without flattery to my friend, he
does. Were I to chuse, of all mankind, a man, on
whom I would rely for faith and counsel, or more,
whose personal aid I would invite, in any worthy
cause, to second me, it should be only Gabriel Towerson;
daring he is, and thereto fortunate; yet soft,
and apt to pity the distressed, and liberal to relieve
them: I have seen him not alone to pardon foes,
but by his bounty win them to his love: If he has
any fault, 'tis only that to which great minds can
only subject be&mdash;he thinks all honest, 'cause himself
is so, and therefore none suspects.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> I like him well for that; this fault of his
great mind, as Beamont calls it, may give him cause
to wish he was more wary, when it shall be too late.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> I was in some small hope, this ship had
<a class="pgnm" id="page_018" name="page_018"></a>
been of our own country, and brought back my son;
for much about this season I expect him. Good-morrow,
gentlemen; I go to fill a brendice to my
noble captain's health, pray tell him so; the youth
of our Amboyna I'll send before, to welcome him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> We'll stay, and meet him here.
<span class="sdr">[Exeunt <span class="cnm">Harman, Fiscal,</span> and <span class="cnm">Van Herring.</span></span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I do not like these fleering Dutchmen,
they overact their kindness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> I know not what to think of them; that old
fat governor, Harman van Spelt, I have known long;
they say he was a cooper in his country, and took
the measure of his hoops for tuns by his own belly:
I love him not, he makes a jest of men in misery;
the first fat merry fool I ever knew, that was ill-natured.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> He's absolutely governed by this Fiscal,
who was, as I have heard, an ignorant advocate in
Rotterdam, such as in England we call a petty-fogging
rogue; one that knows nothing, but the worst
part of the law, its tricks and snares: I fear he hates
us English mortally. Pray heaven we feel not the
effects on't.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> Neither he, nor Harman, will dare to shew their
malice to us, now Towerson is come. For though,
'tis true, we have no castle here, he has an awe upon
them in his worth, which they both fear and reverence.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I wish it so may prove; my mind is a bad
prophet to me, and what it does forbode of ill, it
seldom fails to pay me. Here he comes.</p>

our Dutch governor. I wonder how they met.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> This I am sure of, that our English factories
in all these parts have wished you long the man, and

you relieved me from the pirates, and brought my

gratitude.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> You over-rate a little courtesy: In your deliverance
I did no more, than what I had myself
from you expected: The common ties of our religion,

strict commerce betwixt us and your nation, exacted
all I did, or could have done. [<span class="sdm">To <span class="cnm">Beamont.</span></span>]
For you, my friend, let me ne'er breathe our English

happiness should not be bought at a less price.</p>

Nay, even its luxuries may be supplied from her

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> Do I hold my love, do I embrace him after
a tedious absence of three years? Are you indeed returned,
are you the same? Do you still love your
Isabinda? Speak before I ask you twenty questions
more: For I have so much love, and so much joy,
that if you don't love as well as I, I shall appear
distracted.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> We meet then both out of ourselves, for I
am nothing else but love and joy; and to take care
of my discretion now, would make me much unworthy

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I never will without you.</p>

<h4 class="scn">ACT II. SCENE I.</h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Isabinda,</span> and <span class="cnm">Harman</span> Junior.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> This to me, from you, against your friend!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Have I not eyes? are you not fair?
Why does it seem so strange?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> Come, it is a plot betwixt you: My Englishman
is jealous, and has sent you to try my faith:
he might have spared the experiment, after a three
years absence; that was a proof sufficient of my
constancy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> I heard him say he never had returned,
but that his masters of the East India company
preferred him large conditions.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> You do bely him basely.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> As much as I do you, in saying you
are fair; or as I do myself, when I declare I die for
you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> If this be earnest, you have done a most
unmanly and ungrateful part, to court the intended
wife of him, to whom you are most obliged.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Leave me to answer that: Assure
yourself I love you violently, and, if you are wise,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_024" name="page_024"></a>
you will make some difference betwixt Towerson
and me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> Yes, I shall make a difference, but not to
your advantage.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> You must, or falsify your knowledge;
an Englishman, part captain, and part merchant;
his nation of declining interest here: Consider
this, and weigh against that fellow, not me,
but any, the least and meanest Dutchman in this
isle.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> I do not weigh by bulk: I know your
countrymen have the advantage there.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Hold back your hand, from firming
of your faith; you will thank me in a little time,
for staying you so kindly from embarking in his
ruin.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> His fortune is not so contemptible as you
would make it seem.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Wait but one month for the event.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> I will not wait one day, though I were
sure to sink with him the next: So well I love my
Towerson, I will not lose another sun, for fear he
should not rise to-morrow. For yourself, pray rest
assured, of all mankind, you should not be my
choice, after an act of such ingratitude.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> You may repent your scorn at leisure.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> Never, unless I married you.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Towerson.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Now, my dear Isabinda, I dare pronounce
myself most happy: Since I have gained your kindred,
all difficulties cease.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> I wish we find it so.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Why, is aught happened since I saw you
last? Methinks a sadness dwells upon your brow,
like that I saw before my last long absence. You
<a class="pgnm" id="page_025" name="page_025"></a>
do not speak: My friend dumb too? Nay then, I
fear some more than ordinary cause produces this.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> You have no reason, Towerson, to
be sad; you are the happy man.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> If I have any, you must needs have some.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> No, you are loved, and I am bid
despair.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Time and your services will perhaps make
you as happy, as I am in my Isabinda's love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> I thought I spoke so plain, I might be
understood; but since I did not, I must tell you,
Towerson, I wear the title of your friend no longer,
because I am your rival.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Is this true, Isabinda?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> I should not, I confess, have told you first,
because I would not give you that disquiet; but
since he has, it is too sad a truth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Leave us, my dear, a little to ourselves.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> I fear you will quarrel, for he seemed incensed,
and threatened you with ruin. <span class="sdr">[To him aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> 'Tis to prevent an ill, which may be fatal
to us both, that I would speak with him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> Swear to me, by your love, you will not fight.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Fear not, my Isabinda; things are not
grown to that extremity.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> I leave you, but I doubt the consequence.
<span class="sdr">[Exit <span class="cnm">Isab.</span></span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I want a name to call you by; friend, you
declare you are not, and to rival, I am not yet
enough accustomed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Now I consider on it, it shall be yet
in your free choice, to call me one or other; for,
Towerson, I do not decline your friendship, but
then yield Isabinda to me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Yield Isabinda to you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Yes, and preserve the blessing of my
friendship; I'll make my father yours; your factories
<a class="pgnm" id="page_026" name="page_026"></a>

with ours; your gain shall be beyond
what you could hope for from the treaty: In all
the traffic of these eastern parts, ye shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Hold! you mistake me, Harman, I never
gave you just occasion to think I would make merchandize
of love; Isabinda, you know, is mine, contracted
to me ere I went for England, and must be
so till death.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> She must not, Towerson; you know
you are not strongest in these parts, and it will be
ill contesting with your masters.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Our masters? Harman, you durst not once
have named that word, in any part of Europe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Here I both dare and will; you have no
castles in Amboyna.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Though we have not, we yet have English
hearts, and courages not to endure affronts.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> They may be tried.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Your father sure will not maintain you in
this insolence; I know he is too honest.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Assure yourself he will espouse my
quarrel.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> We would complain to England.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Your countrymen have tried that
course so often, methinks they should grow wiser,
and desist: But now there is no need of troubling
any others but ourselves; the sum of all is this, you
either must resign me Isabinda, or instantly resolve
to clear your title to her by your sword.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I will do neither now.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Then I'll believe you dare not fight me
fairly.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> You know I durst have fought, though I
am not vain enough to boast it, nor would upbraid
you with remembrance of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> You destroy your benefit with rehearsal
<a class="pgnm" id="page_027" name="page_027"></a>
of it; but that was in a ship, backed by your
men; single duel is a fairer trial of your courage.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I'm not to be provoked out of my temper:
Here I am a public person, entrusted by my king
and my employers, and should I kill you, Harman&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Oh never think you can, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I should betray my countrymen to suffer,
not only worse indignities than those they have already
borne, but, for aught I know, might give them
up to general imprisonment, perhaps betray them
to a massacre.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> These are but pitiful and weak excuses;
I'll force you to confess you dare not fight; you shall
have provocations.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I will not stay to take them. Only this before
I go; if you are truly gallant, insult not where
you have power, but keep your quarrel secret; we
may have time and place out of this island: Meanwhile,
I go to marry Isabinda, that you shall see
I dare.&mdash;No more, follow me not an inch beyond

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Whither so fast, mynheer?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> To have his blood is not amiss, so far I go

into the heat of this he came; I offered him the
best advantages he could or to himself propose, or
to his nation, would he quit her love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> So far you are prudent, for she is exceeding
rich.</p>

with my father's power.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> That was unwisely done; your father, underhand,
may do a mischief, but it is too gross aboveboard.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> At last, nought else prevailing, I defied
him to single duel; this he refused, and I believe
it was fear.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> No, no, mistake him not, it is a stout whoreson.
You did ill to press him, it will not sound well
in Europe; he being here a public minister, having
no means of 'scaping should he kill you, besides exposing
all his countrymen to a revenge.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> That's all one; I'm resolved I will
pursue my course, and fight him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Pursue your end, that's to enjoy the woman
and her wealth; I would, like you, have Towerson
despatched,&mdash;for, as I am a true Dutchman, I
do hate him,&mdash;but I would convey him smoothly out
of the world, and without noise; they will say we
are ungrateful else in England, and barbarously
cruel; now I could swallow down the <i>thing</i> ingratitude

odious.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> There's my cuckold that must be, and my
fellow swaggerer, the Dutchman, with my mistress:
my nose is wiped to-day; I must retire, for the Spaniard
is jealous of me.</p>

<span class="sdr">[Exit.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Now, Mr Fiscal, you are the happy man
with the ladies, and have got the precedence of
traffic here too; you've the Indies in your arms,
yet I hope a poor Englishman may come in for a
third part of the merchandise.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Oh, sir, in these commodities, here's enough
for both; here's mace for you, and nutmeg for me, in
the same fruit, and yet the owner has to spare for
other friends too.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> My husband's plantation is like to thrive well
betwixt you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Horn him; he deserves not so much happiness
as he enjoys in you; he's jealous.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> 'Tis no wonder if a Spaniard looks yellow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Betwixt you and me, 'tis a little kind of
venture that we make, in doing this Don's drudgery
for him; for the whole nation of them is generally
so pocky, that 'tis no longer a disease, but a second
nature in them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> I have heard indeed, that 'tis incorporated
among them, as deeply as the Moors and Jews are;
there's scarce a family, but 'tis crept into their blood,
like the new Christians.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> Come, I'll have no whispering betwixt you;
I know you were talking of my husband, because
my nose itches.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Faith, madam, I was speaking in favour
of your nation: What pleasant lives I have known
Spaniards to live in England.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> If you love me, let me hear a little.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_034" name="page_034"></a>
<span class="cnm">Beam.</span> We observed them to have much of the
nature of our flies; they buzzed abroad a month
or two in the summer, would venture about dog-days
to take the air in the Park, but all the winter
slept like dormice; and, if they ever appeared in public
after Michaelmas, their faces shewed the difference
betwixt their country and ours, for they look
in Spain as if they were roasted, and in England as
if they were sodden.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> I'll not believe your description.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Yet our observations of them in Holland
are not much unlike it. I've known a great Don at
the Hague, with the gentleman of his horse, his major
domo, and two secretaries, all dine at four tables,
on the quarters of a single pullet: The victuals
of the under servants were weighed out in
ounces, by the Don himself; with so much garlic
in the other scale: A thin slice of bacon went
through the family a week together; for it was
daily put into the pot for pottage; was served in
the midst of the dish at dinners, and taken out and
weighed by the steward, at the end of every meal,
to see how much it lost; till, at length, looking at
it against the sun, it appeared transparent, and then
he would have whipped it up, as his own fees, at a
morsel; but that his lord barred the dice, and reckoned
it to him for a part of his board wages.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> In few words, madam, the general notion
we had of them, was, that they were very frugal of
their Spanish coin, and very liberal of their Neapolitan.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> I see, gentlemen, you are in the way of rallying;
therefore let me be no hinderance to your
sport; do as much for one another as you have done
for our nation. Pray, Mynheer Fiscal, what think
you of the English?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Oh, I have an honour for the country.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_035" name="page_035"></a>
<span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I beseech you, leave your ceremony; we
can hear of our faults without choler; therefore
speak of us with a true Amsterdam spirit, and do
not spare us.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Since you command me, sir, 'tis said of
you, I know not how truly, that for your fishery at
home, you're like dogs in the manger, you will neither
manage it yourselves, nor permit your neighbours;
so that for your sovereignty of the narrow
seas, if the inhabitants of them, the herrings, were
capable of being judges, they would certainly award
it to the English, because they were then sure to
live undisturbed, and quiet under you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Very good; proceed, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> 'Tis true, you gave us aid in our time of need,
but you paid yourselves with our cautionary towns:
And, that you have since delivered them up, we
can never give sufficient commendation, either to
your honesty, or to your wit; for both which qualities
you have purchased such an immortal fame,
that all nations are instructed how to deal with you
another time.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> A most grateful acknowledgment; sweet
sir, go on.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> For your trade abroad, if you should obtain
it, you are so horribly expensive, that you would
undo yourselves and all Christendom; for you
would sink under your very profit, and the gains
of the universal world would beggar you: You devour
a voyage to the Indies, by the multitude of
mouths with which you man your vessels: Providence
has contrived it well, that the Indies are managed
by us, an industrious and frugal people, who
distribute its merchandise to the rest of Europe,
and suffer it not to be consumed in England, that
the other members might be starved, while you of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_036" name="page_036"></a>
Great Britain, as you call it, like a rickety head,
would only swell and grow bigger by it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> I have heard enough of England; have you
nothing to return upon the Netherlands?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Faith, very little to any purpose; he has
been beforehand with us, as his countrymen are in
their trade, and taken up so many vices for the use
of England, that he has left almost none for the
Low Countries.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> Come, a word, however.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> In the first place, you shewed your ambition
when you began to be a state: For not
being gentlemen, you have stolen the arms of the
best families of Europe; and wanting a name, you
made bold with the first of the divine attributes,
and called yourselves the High and Mighty: though,
let me tell you, that, besides the blasphemy, the title
is ridiculous; for High is no more proper for the
Netherlands, than Mighty is for seven little rascally
provinces, no bigger in all than a shire in England.
For my main theme, your ingratitude, you have in
part acknowledged it, by your laughing at our easy
delivery of your cautionary towns: The best is, we
are used by you as well as your own princes of the
house of Orange: We and they have set you up,
and you undermine their power, and circumvent our
trade.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> And good reason, if our interest requires it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> That leads me to your religion, which is
only made up of interest: At home, you tolerate
all worships in them who can pay for it; and
abroad, you were lately so civil to the emperor of
Pegu, as to do open sacrifice to his idols.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Yes, and by the same token, you English
were such precise fools as to refuse it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> For frugality in trading, we confess we
cannot compare with you; for our merchants live
<a class="pgnm" id="page_037" name="page_037"></a>
like noblemen; your gentlemen, if you have any,
live like boors. You traffic for all the rarities of the
world, and dare use none of them yourselves; so
that, in effect, you are the mill-horses of mankind,
that labour only for the wretched provender you
eat: A pot of butter and a pickled herring is all
your riches; and, in short, you have a good title to
cheat all Europe, because, in the first place, you cozen
your own backs and bellies.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> We may enjoy more whenever we please.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Your liberty is a grosser cheat than any
of the rest; for you are ten times more taxed than
any people in Christendom: You never keep any
league with foreign princes; you flatter our kings,
and ruin their subjects; you never denied us satisfaction
at home for injuries, nor ever gave it us
abroad.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You must make yourselves more feared,
when you expect it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> And I prophecy that time will come, when
some generous monarch of our island will undertake
our quarrel, reassume the fishery of our seas,
and make them as considerable to the English, as
the Indies are to you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Before that comes to pass, you may repent
your over-lavish tongue.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I was no more in earnest than you were.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> Pray let this go no further; my husband has
invited both to supper.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> If you please, I'll fall to before he comes;
or, at least, while he is conferring in private with
the Fiscal.<br />

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Perez.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Per.</span> True, the reward proposed is great enough,
I want it too; besides, this Englishman has never

long promised me, but what are promises to starving
men? this is his house, he may walk out this
morning.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter a Page, and another Servant, walking by, not

<p class="dlg">These belong to him; I'll hide till they are past.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serv.</span> He bid we should not wake him; but some

my money half beforehand: up, Perez, rouse thy
Spanish courage up; if he should wake, I think I

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Per.</span> Asleep, as I imagined, and as fast as all the

temples. Oh that some courteous d&aelig;mon, in the
other world, would let him know, 'twas Perez sent
him thither! A paper by him too! He little thinks
it is his testament; the last he e'er shall make: I'll
read it first. [<span class="sdm">Takes it up.</span>] Oh, by the inscription,
'tis a memorial of what he means to do this day:
What's here? My name in the first line! I'll read it.
[<span class="sdm">Reads.</span>] <i>Memorandum, That my first action this
morning shall be, to find out my true and valiant lieutenant,

it not before within my power to reward him.</i> [<span class="sdm">Lays
down the paper.</span>] And was it then for this I sought
his life? Oh base, degenerate Spaniard! Hadst thou

this paper to my timely view. Sleep on, thou honourable

to enjoy a pleasing dream can be to sleep too long.
Methought my dear Isabinda and myself were lying
in an arbour, wreathed about with myrtle and
with cypress; my rival Harman, reconciled again
to his friendship, strewed us with flowers, and put
on each a crimson-coloured garment, in which we
straightway mounted to the skies; and with us,
many of my English friends, all clad in the same
robes. If dreams have any meaning, sure this portends
some good.&mdash;What's that I see! A dagger
stuck into the paper of my memorials, and writ below&mdash;<i>Thy
virtue saved thy life!</i> It seems some one
has been within my chamber whilst I slept: Something
of consequence hangs upon this accident.
What, ho! who waits without? None answer me?

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> A little discomposed: read that, and see if

I have no occasion; that dagger was stuck there,

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I must confess you have too just a cause:
I am myself surprised at an event so strange.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I know not who can be my enemy within
this island, except my rival Harman; and for him,
I truly did relate what passed betwixt us yesterday.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> You bore yourself in that as it became
you, as one who was a witness to himself of his own
courage; and while, by necessary care of others,
you were forced to decline fighting, shewed how
much you did despise the man who sought the
quarrel: 'Twas base in him, so backed as he is here,
to offer it, much more to press you to it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> I may find a foot of ground in Europe to
tell the insulting youth, he better had provoked

who left that dagger there.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> No, for it seems too great a nobleness of
spirit, for one like him to practise: 'Twas certainly
an enemy, who came to take your sleeping life;
but thus to leave unfinished the design, proclaims
the act no Dutchman's.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow</span> That time will best discover; I'll think no

the rest let her relate.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Pray, countrywoman, speak.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Eng Wom.</span> Then thus in brief; in my dear husband's
company, I parted from our sweet native isle:
<a class="pgnm" id="page_048" name="page_048"></a>
we to Lantore were bound, with letters from the
States of Holland, gained for reparation of great
damages sustained by us; when, by the insulting
Dutch, our countrymen, against all show of right,
were dispossessed, and naked sent away from that
rich island, and from Poleroon.</p>

spleen; I must not hear my countrymen affronted.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Eng. Wom..</span> I wish they did not merit much worse
of me, than I can say of them.&mdash;Well, we sailed
forward with a merry gale, till near St Helen's isle
we were overtaken, or rather waylaid, by a Holland
vessel; the captain of which ship, whom here I see,
the man who quitted us of all we had in those rich
parts before, now fearing to restore his ill-got goods,
first hailed, and then invited us on board, keeping
himself concealed; his base lieutenant plied all our
English mariners with wine, and when in dead of
night they lay secure in silent sleep, most barbarously
commanded they should be thrown overboard.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Sir, do not hear it out.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Sen.</span> This is all false and scandalous.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Eng. Wom.</span> The vessel rifled, and the rich hold
rummaged, they sink it down to rights; but first I
should have told you, (grief, alas, has spoiled my
memory) that my dear husband, wakened at the
noise, before they reached the cabin where we lay,
took me all trembling with the sudden fright, and
leapt into the boat; we cut the cordage, and so put
out to sea, driving at mercy of the waves and wind;
so scaped we in the dark. To sum up all, we got to
shore, and in the mountains hid us, until the barbarous
Hollanders were gone.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Where is your husband, countrywoman?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Eng. Wom.</span> Dead with grief; with these two
hands I scratched him out a grave, on which I placed
<a class="pgnm" id="page_049" name="page_049"></a>
a cross, and every day wept o'er the ground where
all my joys lay buried. The manner of my life, who
can express! the fountain-water was my only drink;
the crabbed juice and rhind of half-ripe lemons
almost my only food, except some roots; my house,
the widowed cave of some wild beast. In this sad
state, I stood upon the shore, when this brave captain
with his ship approached, whence holding up and
waving both my hands, I stood, and by my actions
begged their mercy; yet, when they nearer came, I
would have fled, had I been able, lest they should
have proved those murderous Dutch, I more than
hunger feared.</p>

the world; he has all this, while he is ignorant.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> You pervert my meaning: I would not

resolve to make me happy by your free consent. I
do not love these half enjoyments, to enervate my

have, but where both join with equal eagerness to

You know you were now going to your bridal-bed.
Call your own thoughts but to a strict account,
they'll tell you, all this day your fancy ran on nothing

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Harman</span> Senior, <span class="cnm">Fiscal, Van Herring,
Beamont, Collins,</span> and <span class="cnm">Julia.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> You have led us here a fairy's round in the
moonshine, to seek a bridegroom in a wood, till we
have lost the bride.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> I wonder what's become of her?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Sen.</span> Got together, got together, I warrant
you, before this time; you Englishmen are so hot,
you cannot stay for ceremonies. A good honest
Dutchman would have been plying the glass all this
while, and drunk to the hopes of Hans in Kelder
till 'twas bed-time.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Yes, and then have rolled into the sheets,
and turned o' the t'other side to snore, without so
much as a parting blow; till about midnight he would
have wakened in a maze, and found first he was
married by putting forth a foot, and feeling a woman
by him; and, it may be, then, instead of kissing,
desired yough Fro to hold his head.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> And by that night's work have given her a
proof, what she might expect for ever after.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> In my conscience, you Hollanders never
get your children, but in the spirit of brandy; you
are exalted then a little above your natural phlegm,
and only that, which can make you fight, and destroy
men, makes you get them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You may live to know, that we can kill men
when we are sober.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Then they must be drunk, and not able to
defend themselves.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jul.</span> Pray leave this talk, and let us try if we can
surprise the lovers under some convenient tree: Shall
we separate, and look them?</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_058" name="page_058"></a>
<span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Let you and I go together then, and if
we cannot find them, we shall do as good, for we
shall find one another.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Pray take that path, or that; I will pursue
this.<span class="sdr">[Exeunt all but the <span class="cnm">Fiscal.</span></span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> So, now I have diverted them from Harman,
I'll look for him myself, and see how he speeds
in his adventure.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Harman</span> Junior.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Who goes there?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> A friend: I was just in quest of you, so are
all the company: Where have you left the bride?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Tied to a tree and gagged, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> And what? Why do you stare and tremble?
Answer me like a man.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Oh, I have nothing left of manhood
in me! I am turned beast or devil. Have I not horns,
and tail, and leathern wings? Methinks I should have
by my actions. Oh, I have done a deed so ill, I cannot
name it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Not name it, and yet do it? That's a fool's
modesty: Come, I'll name it for you: You have
enjoyed your mistress.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> How easily so great a villany comes
from thy mouth! I have done worse, I have ravished
her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> That's no harm, so you have killed her afterwards.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Killed her! why thou art a worse fiend
than I.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Those fits of conscience in another might be
excusable; but in you, a Dutchman, who are of a
race that are born rebels, and live every where on
rapine,&mdash;would you degenerate, and have remorse?
Pray, what makes any thing a sin but law? and,
what law is there here against it? Is not your father
chief? Will he condemn you for a petty rape?
<a class="pgnm" id="page_059" name="page_059"></a>
the woman an Amboyner, and, what's less, now
married to an Englishman! Come, if there be a hell,
'tis but for those that sin in Europe, not for us in
Asia; heathens have no hell. Tell me, how was't?
Pr'ythee, the history.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> I forced her. What resistance she could
make she did, but 'twas in vain; I bound her, as I
told you, to a tree.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> And she exclaimed, I warrant&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> Yes; and called heaven and earth to
witness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Not after it was done?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> More than before&mdash;desired me to
have killed her. Even when I had not left her
power to speak, she curst me with her eyes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Nay, then, you did not please her; if you
had, she ne'er had cursed you heartily. But we lose
time: Since you have done this action, 'tis necessary
you proceed; we must have no tales told.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> To dispatch her immediately; could you be
so senseless to ravish her, and let her live? What if
her husband should have found her? What if any
other English? Come, there's no dallying; it must
be done: My other plot is ripe, which shall destroy
them all to-morrow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har. Jun.</span> I love her still to madness, and never
can consent to have her killed. We'll thence remove
her, if you please, and keep her safe till your intended
plot shall take effect; and when her husband's
gone, I'll win her love by every circumstance of
kindness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You may do so; but t'other is the safer
way: But I'll not stand with you for one life. I
could have wished that Towerson had been killed before
I had proceeded to my plot; but since it cannot
be, we must go on; conduct me where you left her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_060" name="page_060"></a>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> No longer bridegroom thou, nor I a bride;<br />
Those names are vanished; love is now no more;<br />
Look on me as thou would'st on some foul leper;<br />
And do not touch me; I am all polluted,<br />
All shame, all o'er dishonour; fly my sight,<br />
And, for my sake, fly this detested isle,<br />
Where horrid ills so black and fatal dwell,<br />
As Indians could not guess, till Europe taught.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Speak plainer, I am recollected now:<br />
I know I am a man, the sport of fate;<br />
Yet, oh my better half, had heaven so pleased,<br />
I had been more content, to suffer in myself than thee!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> What shall I say! That monster of a man,<br />
Harman,&mdash;now I have named him, think the rest,&mdash;<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_061" name="page_061"></a>
Alone, and singled like a timorous hind<br />
From the full herd, by flattery drew me first,<br />
Then forced me to an act, so base and brutal!<br />
Heaven knows my innocence: But, why do I<br />
Call that to witness!<br />
Heaven saw, stood silent: Not one flash of lightning<br />
Shot from the conscious firmament, to shew its justice:<br />
Oh had it struck us both, it had saved me!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Heaven suffered more in that, than you, or I,<br />
Wherefore have I been faithful to my trust,<br />
True to my love, and tender to the opprest?<br />
Am I condemned to be the second man,<br />
Who e'er complained he virtue served in vain?<br />
But dry your tears, these sufferings all are mine.<br />
Your breast is white, and cold as falling snow;<br />
You, still as fragrant as your eastern groves;<br />
And your whole frame as innocent, and holy,<br />
As if your being were all soul and spirit,<br />
Without the gross allay of flesh and blood.<br />
Come to my arms again!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Isab.</span> O never, never!<br />
I am not worthy now; my soul indeed<br />
Is free from sin; but the foul speckled stains<br />
Are from my body ne'er to be washed out,<br />
But in my death. Kill me, my love, or I<br />
Must kill myself; else you may think I was<br />
A black adultress in my mind, and some<br />
Of me consented.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Your wish to die, shews you deserve to live.<br />
I have proclaimed you guiltless to myself.<br />
Self-homicide, which was, in heathens, honour,<br />
In us, is only sin.</p>

Had made us masters of these mortal frames;<br />
You told me, he had given us wills to chuse,<br />

If so, why should he tie us up from dying,<br />
When death's the greater good?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Can death, which is our greatest enemy, be good?<br />
Death is the dissolution of our nature;<br />
And nature therefore does abhor it most,<br />
Whose greatest law is&mdash;to preserve our beings.</p>

But as kings, who are, or should be, above laws,<br />
Dispense with them when levelled at themselves;<br />
Even so may man, without offence to heaven,<br />
Dispense with what concerns himself alone.<br />
Nor is death in itself an ill;<br />
Then holy martyrs sinned, who ran uncalled<br />
To snatch their martyrdom; and blessed virgins,<br />
Whom you celebrate for voluntary death,<br />
To free themselves from that which I have suffered.</p>

To heaven's tribunal my appeal I make;<br />
If as a governor he sets me here,<br />

both, I believe, possest him; or your son was innocently
talking with his wife, and he perhaps had
found them; this I guess, but saw it not, because
I came too late. I only viewed the sweet youth
just expiring, and Towerson stooping down to take
the ring; she kneeling by to help him: when he
saw me, he would, you may be sure, have sent me
after, because I was a witness of the fact. This on
my soul is true.</p>

<h4 class="scn">ACT V.<br />
SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Table set out.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Harman, Fiscal, Van Herring,</span> and two
Dutchmen: They sit. Boy, and Waiters, Guards.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> My sorrow cannot be so soon digested for
losing of a son I loved so well; but I consider great
advantages must with some loss be bought; as
this rich trade which I this day have purchased
with his death: yet let me lie revenged, and I shall
still live on, and eat and drink down all my griefs.
Now to the matter, Fiscal.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Since we may freely speak among ourselves,
all I have said of Towerson was most false. You
were consenting, sir, as well as I, that Perez should
be hired to murder him, which he refusing when
he was engaged, 'tis dangerous to let him longer live.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van. Her.</span> Dispatch him; he will be a shrewd witness
against us, if he returns to Europe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> I have thought better, if you please,&mdash;to kill
him by form of law, as accessary to the English
plot, which I have long been forging.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Send one to seize him strait. [<span class="sdm">Exit a Messenger.</span>]
But what you said, that Towerson was
<a class="pgnm" id="page_070" name="page_070"></a>
guiltless of my son's death, I easily believe, and
never thought otherwise, though I dissembled.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Nor I; but it was well done to feign
that story.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Dutch.</span> The true one was too foul.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Dutch.</span> And afterwards to draw the English off
from his concernment, to their own, I think 'twas
rarely managed that.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> So far, 'twas well; now to proceed, for I
would gladly know, whether the grounds are plausible
enough of this pretended plot.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> With favour of this honourable court, give
me but leave to smooth the way before you. Some
two or three nights since, (it matters not,) a Japan
soldier, under captain Perez, came to a centinel upon
the guard, and in familiar talk did question
him about this castle, of its strength, and how he
thought it might be taken; this discourse the other
told me early the next morning: I thereupon did
issue private orders, to rack the Japanese, myself
being present.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> But what's this to the English?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You shall hear: I asked him, when his pains
were strongest on him, if Towerson, or the English
factory, had never hired him to betray the fort? he
answered, (as it was true) they never had; nor was
his meaning more in that discourse, than as a soldier
to inform himself, and so to pass the time.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> Did he confess no more?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You interrupt me. I told him, I was certainly
informed the English had designs upon the
castle, and if he frankly would confess their plot,
he should not only be released from torment, but
bounteously rewarded: Present pain and future
hope, in fine, so wrought upon him, he yielded to
subscribe whatever I pleased; and so he stands
committed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_071" name="page_071"></a>
<span class="cnm">Har.</span> Well contrived; a fair way made, upon this
accusation, to put them all to torture.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Dutch.</span> By his confession, all of them shall die,
even to their general, Towerson.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> He stands convicted of another crime, for
which he is to suffer.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> This does well to help it though: For
Towerson is here a person publicly employed from
England, and if he should appeal, as sure he will,
you have no power to judge him in Amboyna.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> But in regard of the late league and
union betwixt the nations, how can this be answered?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Dutch.</span> To torture subjects to so great a king,
a pain never heard of in their happy land, will sound
but ill in Europe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Their English laws in England have their
force; and we have ours, different from theirs at
home. It is enough, they either shall confess, or we
will falsify their hands to make them. Then, for
the apology, let me alone; I have it writ already to
a title, of what they shall subscribe; this I will
publish, and make our most unheard of cruelties to
seem most just and legal.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Then, in the name of him, who put it first
into thy head to form this damned false plot, proceed
we to the execution of it. And to begin;
first seize we their effects, rifle their chests, their
boxes, writings, books, and take of them a seeming inventory;
but all to our own use.&mdash;I shall grow young
with thought of this, and lose my son's remembrance!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> Will you not please to call the prisoners in?
At least inquire what torments have extorted.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Go thou and bring us word. [<span class="sdm">Exit <span class="cnm">Fiscal.</span></span>]
Boy, give me some tobacco, and a stoup of wine, boy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Boy.</span> I shall, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> And a tub to leak in, boy; when was this
table without a leaking vessel?</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_072" name="page_072"></a>
<span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> That's an omission.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Dutch.</span> A great omission. 'Tis a member of
the table, I take it so.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Never any thing of moment was done at
our council-table without a leaking tub, at least in
my time; great affairs require great consultations,
great consultations require great drinking, and great
drinking a great leaking vessel.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> I am even drunk with joy already, to
see our godly business in this forwardness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> At the door.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Bring them in; I'll try if we can face them
down by impudence, and make them to confess.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Beamont</span> and <span class="cnm">Collins,</span> guarded.</p>

<p class="dlg">You are not ignorant of our business with you: the
cries of your accomplices have already reached your
ears; and your own consciences, above a thousand
summons, a thousand tortures, instruct you what to

and truth to be delivered now; a free confession
will first atone for all your sins above, and may
do much below to gain your pardons. Let me exhort
you, therefore, be you merciful, first to yourselves
and make acknowledgment of your conspiracy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> What conspiracy?</p>

of two Japanese, these English starts dare
ask what plot it is!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Not to inform your knowledge, but that
law may have its course in every circumstance,
Fiscal, sum up their accusation to them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You stand accused, that new-year's day last
past, there met at captain Towerson's house, you
present, and many others of your factory: There,
against law and justice, and all ties of friendship,
and of partnership betwixt us, you did conspire to
seize upon the fort, to murder this our worthy governor;
and, by the help of your plantations near, of
Jacatra, Banda, and Loho, to keep it for yourselves.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> What proofs have you of this?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> The confession of two Japanese, hired by
you to attempt it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> I hear they have been forced by torture
to it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> It matters not which way the truth comes
out; take heed, for their example is before you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Ye have no right, ye dare not torture us;
we owe you no subjection.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> That, sir, must be disputed at the Hague;
in the mean time we are in possession here.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Dutch.</span> And we can make ourselves to be obeyed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Van Her.</span> In few words, gentlemen, confess.
There is a beverage ready for you else, which you
will not like to swallow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> How is this?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> You shall be muffled up like ladies, with
<a class="pgnm" id="page_074" name="page_074"></a>
an oiled cloth put underneath your chins, then water
poured above; which either you must drink, or
must not breathe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Dutch.</span> That is one way, we have others.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Yes, we have two elements at your service,
fire, as well as water; certain things called matches
to be tied to your finger-ends, which are as sovereign
as nutmegs to quicken your short memories.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> You are inhuman, to make your cruelty
your pastime: nature made me a man, and not a
whale, to swallow down a flood.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> You will grow a corpulent gentleman like
me; I shall love you the better for it; now you are
but a spare rib.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> These things are only offered to your choice;
you may avoid your tortures, and confess.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Col.</span> Kill us first; for that we know is your design
at last, and 'tis more mercy now.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Be kind, and execute us while we bear
the shapes of men, ere fire and water have destroyed
our figures; let me go whole out of the world,
I care not, and find my body when I rise again, so
as I need not be ashamed of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> 'Tis well you are merry; will you yet confess?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Beam.</span> Never.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Now, captain Towerson, you have had the
privilege to be examined last; this on the score of
my old friendship with you, though you have ill
deserved it. But here you stand accused of no
less crimes than robbery first, then murder, and last,
treason: What can you say to clear yourself?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> You're interested in all, and therefore partial:<br />
I have considered on it, and will not plead,<br />
Because I know you have no right to judge me;<br />
For the last treaty betwixt our king and you<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_078" name="page_078"></a>
Expressly said, that causes criminal<br />
Were first to be examined, and then judged,<br />
Not here, but by the Council of Defence;<br />
To whom I make appeal.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> This court conceives that it has power to
judge you, derived from the most high and mighty
states, who in this island are supreme, and that as
well in criminal as civil causes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Dutch.</span> You are not to question the authority
of the court, which is to judge you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Sir, by your favour, I both must, and will:<br />
I'll not so far betray my nation's right;<br />
We are not here your subjects, but your partners:<br />
And that supremacy of power, you claim,<br />
Extends but to the natives, not to us:<br />
Dare you, who in the British seas strike sail,<br />
Nay more, whose lives and freedom are our alms,<br />
Presume to sit and judge your benefactors?<br />
Your base new upstart commonwealth should blush,<br />
To doom the subjects of an English king,<br />
The meanest of whose merchants would disdain<br />
The narrow life, and the domestic baseness,<br />
Of one of those you call your Mighty States.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> You spend your breath in railing; speak to

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Hold yet: Because you shall not call us cruel,<br />

I shall accept of that appeal you make,<br />
Concerning my son's death; provided first,<br />
You clear yourself from what concerns the public;<br />
For that relating to our general safety,<br />
The judgment of it cannot be deferred,<br />
But with our common danger.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Let me first<br />
Be bold to question you: What circumstance<br />
Can make this, your pretended plot, seem likely?<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_079" name="page_079"></a>
The natives, first, you tortured; their confession,<br />
Extorted so, can prove no crime in us.<br />
Consider, next, the strength of this your castle;<br />
Its garrison above two hundred men,<br />
Besides as many of your city burghers,<br />
All ready on the least alarm, or summons,<br />
To reinforce the others; for ten English,<br />
And merchants they, not soldiers, with the aid<br />
Of ten Japanners, all of them unarmed,<br />
Except five swords, and not so many muskets,&mdash;<br />
The attempt had only been for fools or madmen.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> We cannot help your want of wit; proceed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Tow.</span> Grant then we had been desperate enough<br />
To hazard this; we must at least forecast,<br />
How to secure possession when we had it.<br />
We had no ship nor pinnace in the harbour,<br />
Nor could have aid from any factory:<br />
The nearest to us forty leagues from hence,<br />
And they but few in number: You, besides<br />
This fort, have yet three castles in this isle,<br />
Amply provided for, and eight tall ships<br />
Riding at anchor near; consider this,<br />
And think what all the world will judge of it.</p>

From such a tongue, whose heart is fouled with treason.<br />
Give him the beverage.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fisc.</span> 'Tis ready, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Har.</span> Hold; I have some reluctance to proceed<br />

<h3 class="chap">THE STATE OF INNOCENCE, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>The "Paradise Lost" of Milton is a work so extraordinary
in conception and execution, that it required a lapse of many years
to reconcile the herd of readers, and of critics, to what was almost
too sublime for ordinary understandings. The poets, in particular,
seemed to have gazed on its excellencies, like the inferior animals
on Dryden's immortal Hind; and, incapable of fully estimating
a merit, which, in some degree, they could not help feeling,
many were their absurd experiments to lower it to the standard
of their own comprehension. One author, deeming the "Paradise
Lost" deficient in harmony, was pleased painfully to turn
it into rhyme; and more than one, conceiving the subject too serious
to be treated in verse of any kind, employed their leisure in
humbling it into prose. The names of these well-judging and
considerate persons are preserved by Mr Todd in his edition of
Milton's Poetical Works.</p>

<p>But we must not confound with these effusions of gratuitous folly
an alteration, or imitation, planned and executed by John Dryden;
although we may be at a loss to guess the motives by which
he was guided in hazarding such an attempt. His reverence for Milton
and his high estimation of his poetry, had already called forth the
well-known verses, in which he attributes to him the joint excellencies
of the two most celebrated poets of antiquity; and if other
proofs of his veneration were wanting, they may be found in
the preface to this very production. Had the subject been
of a nature which admitted its being actually represented, we
might conceive, that Dryden, who was under engagements to the
theatre, with which it was not always easy to comply, might
have been desirous to shorten his own labour, by adopting the story
sentiments, and language of a poem, which he so highly esteemed
and which might probably have been new to the generality
of his audience. But the <i>costume</i> of our first parents, had
there been no other objection, must have excluded the "State of
Innocence" from the stage, and accordingly it was certainly never
intended for representation. The probable motive, therefore, of
this alteration, was the wish, so common to genius, to exert itself upon
a subject in which another had already attained brilliant success,
or, as Dryden has termed a similar attempt, the desire to shoot in the
bow of Ulysses. Some circumstances in the history of Milton's immortal
poem may have suggested to Dryden the precise form of the
present attempt. It is reported by Voltaire, and seems at length to
be admitted, that the original idea of the "Paradise Lost" was supplied
by an Italian Mystery, or religious play, which Milton witnessed
when abroad<a class="ftnt" href="#State_1-1">[1]</a>; and it is certain, that he intended at first to mould
<a class="pgnm" id="page_092" name="page_092"></a>
his poem into a dramatic form<a class="ftnt" href="#State_1-2">[2]</a>. It seems, therefore, likely, that
Dryden, conscious of his own powers, and enthusiastically admiring
those of Milton, was induced to make an experiment upon the forsaken
plan of the blind bard, which, with his usual rapidity of conception
and execution, he completed in the short space of one month.
The spurious copies which got abroad, and perhaps the desire of testifying
his respect for his beautiful patroness, the Duchess of York,
form his own apology for the publication. It is reported by Mr Aubrey
that the step was not taken without Dryden's reverence to Milton
being testified by a personal application for his permission. The
aged poet, conscious that the might of his versification could receive
no addition even from the flowing numbers of Dryden, is
stated to have answered with indifference&mdash;"Ay, you may <i>tag</i> my
verses, if you will."</p>

<p>The structure and diction of this opera, as it is somewhat improperly
termed, being rather a dramatic poem, strongly indicate
the taste of Charles the Second's reign, for what was ingenious,
acute, and polished, in preference to the simplicity of the true sublime.
The judgment of that age, as has been already noticed, is
always to be referred rather to the head than to the heart; and
a poem, written to please mere critics, requires an introduction
and display of art, to the exclusion of natural beauty.&mdash;This
explains the extravagant panegyric of Lee on Dryden's play:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;Milton did the wealthy mine disclose,</p>
<p>And rudely cast what you could well dispose;</p>
<p>He roughly drew, on an old-fashioned ground,</p>
<p>A chaos; for no perfect world was found,</p>
<p>Till through the heap your mighty genius shined:</p>
<p>He was the golden ore, which you refined.</p>
<p>He first beheld the beauteous rustic maid,</p>
<p>And to a place of strength the prize conveyed:</p>
<p>You took her thence; to Court this virgin brought,</p>
<p>Dressed her with gems, new-weaved her hard-spun thought,</p>
<p>And softest language sweetest manners taught;</p>
<p>Till from a comet she a star did rise,</p>
<p>Not to affright, but please, our wondering eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>Doubtless there were several critics of that period, who
held the heretical opinion above expressed by Lee. And the
imitation was such as to warrant that conclusion, considering
the school in which it was formed. The scene of the consultation
in Pandemonium, and of the soliloquy of Satan on his
<a class="pgnm" id="page_093" name="page_093"></a>
arrival in the newly-created universe, would possess great merit,
did they not unfortunately remind us of the majestic simplicity
of Milton. But there is often a sort of Ovidian point in the diction
which seems misplaced. Thus, Asmodeus tells us, that the
devils, ascending from the lake of fire,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Shake off their slumber <i>first</i>, and <i>next</i> their fear.</p>
</div>

<p>And, with Dryden's usual hate to the poor Dutchmen, the council
of Pandemonium are termed,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Most High and Mighty</i> Lords, who better fell</p>
<p>From heaven, to rise <i>States General</i> of hell.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one inconvenience, which, as this poem was intended
for perusal only, the author, one would have thought, might
have easily avoided. This arises from the stage directions, which
supply the place of the terrific and beautiful descriptions of Milton.
What idea, except burlesque, can we form of the expulsion
of the fallen angels from heaven, literally represented by their tumbling
down upon the stage? or what feelings of terror can be excited
by the idea of an opera hell, composed of pasteboard and flaming
rosin? If these follies were not actually to be produced before our
eyes, it could serve no good purpose to excite the image of them in
our imaginations. They are circumstances by which we feel, that
scenic deception must be rendered ridiculous; and ought to be
avoided, even in a drama intended for perusal only, since they
cannot be mentioned without exciting ludicrous combinations.&mdash;Even
in describing the primitive state of our first parents, Dryden
has displayed some of the false and corrupted taste of the court
of Charles. Eve does not consent to her union with Adam without
coquettish apprehensions of his infidelity, which circumstances
rendered rather improbable; and even in the state of innocence,
she avows the love of sway and of self, which, in a loose age, is
thought the principal attribute of her daughters. It may be remembered
that the Adam of Milton, when first experiencing the
powers of slumber, thought,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>I then was passing to my former state</p>
<p>Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">The Eve of Dryden expresses the same apprehensions of annihilation
upon a very different occasion. These passages form a contrast
highly favourable to the simplicity and chastity of Milton's
taste. The school logic, employed by Adam and the angels in the
first scene of the fourth act, however misplaced, may be paralleled
if not justified, by similar instances in the "Paradise Lost."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the "State of Innocence" contains many
passages of varied and happy expression peculiar to our great poet;
and the speech of Lucfier in Paradise (Act third, scene first), approaches
in sublimity to his prototype in Milton, Indeed, altered
as this poem was from the original, in order to accommodate it
to the taste of a frivolous age, it still retained too much fancy to
<a class="pgnm" id="page_094" name="page_094"></a>
escape the raillery of the men of wit and fashion, more disposed
to "laugh at extravagance, than to sympathise with feelings of
grandeur." The "Companion to the Theatre" mentions an objection
started by the more nice and delicate critics, against the
anachronism and absurdity of Lucifer conversing about the world,
its form and vicissitudes, at a time previous to its creation, or, at
least, to the possibility of his knowing any thing of it. But to this
objection, which applies to the "Paradise Lost" also, it is sufficient to
reply, that the measure of intelligence, competent to supernatural
beings, being altogether unknown to us, leaves the poet at liberty
to accommodate its extent to the purposes in which he employs
them, without which poetic license, it would be in vain to introduce
them. Dryden, moved by this, and similar objections, has
prefixed to the drama, "An Apology for Heroic Poetry," and the
use of what is technically called "the machinery" employed in it.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it may be justly questioned, whether Dryden
shewed his judgment in the choice of a subject which compelled
an immediate parallel betwixt Milton and himself, upon a subject
so exclusively favourable to the powers of the former. Indeed,
according to Dennis, notwithstanding Dryden's admiration of
Milton, he evinced sufficiently by this undertaking, what he
himself confessed twenty years afterwards, that he was not sensible
of half the extent of his excellence. In the "Town and Country
Mouse," Mr Bayes is made to term Milton "a rough unhewen
fellow;" and Dryden himself, even in the dedication to the Translation
from Juvenal, a work of his advanced life, alleges, that,
though he found in that poet a true sublimity, and lofty thoughts,
clothed with admirable Grecisms, he did not find the elegant turn
of words and expression proper to the Italian poets and to Spenser.
In the same treatise, he undertakes to excuse, but not to
justify Milton, for his choice of blank verse, affirming that he possessed
neither grace nor facility in rhyming. A consciousness of
the harmony of his own numbers, and a predilection for that kind
of verse, in which he excelled, seemed to have encouraged him to
think he could improve the "Paradise Lost." Baker observes but
too truly, that the "State of Innocence" recals the idea reprobated
by Marvell in his address to Milton:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Or if a work so infinite be spanned,</p>
<p>Jealous I was, lest some less skilful hand,</p>
<p>Such as disquiet always what is well,</p>
<p>And by ill-imitating would excel,</p>
<p>Might hence presume the whole creation's day</p>
<p>To change in scenes, and shew it in a play.</p>
</div>

<p>The "State of Innocence" seems to have been undertaken by Dryden
during a cessation of his theatrical labours, and was first published
in 1674, shortly after the death of Milton, which took place
on the 8th of November in the same year.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE
DUCHESS<a class="ftnt" href="#State_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noind smcap">Madam,</p>

<p>Ambition is so far from being a vice in poets,
that it is almost impossible for them to succeed without
it. Imagination must be raised, by a desire of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_096" name="page_096"></a>
fame, to a desire of pleasing; and they whom, in all
ages, poets have endeavoured most to please, have
<a class="pgnm" id="page_097" name="page_097"></a>
been the beautiful and the great. Beauty is their
deity, to which they sacrifice, and greatness is their
guardian angel, which protects them. Both these,
are so eminently joined in the person of your royal
highness, that it were not easy for any but a poet
to determine which of them outshines the other.
But I confess, madam, I am already biassed in my
choice. I can easily resign to others the praise of
your illustrious family, and that glory which you
derive from a long-continued race of princes, famous
for their actions both in peace and war: I
can give up, to the historians of your country, the
names of so many generals and heroes which crowd
their annals, and to our own the hopes of those
which you are to produce for the British chronicle.
<a class="pgnm" id="page_098" name="page_098"></a>
I can yield, without envy, to the nation of
poets, the family of Este, to which Ariosto and
Tasso have owed their patronage, and to which the
world has owed their poems. But I could not, without
extreme reluctance, resign the theme of your
beauty to another hand. Give me leave, madam,
to acquaint the world, that I am jealous of this
subject; and let it be no dishonour to you, that, after
having raised the admiration of mankind, you
have inspired one man to give it voice. But, with
whatsoever vanity this new honour of being your
poet has filled my mind, I confess myself too weak
for the inspiration: the priest was always unequal
to the oracle: the god within him was too mighty
for his breast: he laboured with the sacred revelation,
and there was more of the mystery left behind,
than the divinity itself could enable him to express.
I can but discover a part of your excellencies to the
world; and that, too, according to the measure of
my own weakness. Like those who have surveyed
the moon by glasses, I can only tell of a new and
shining world above us, but not relate the riches
and glories of the place. 'Tis therefore that I have
already waved the subject of your greatness, to resign
myself to the contemplation of what is more
peculiarly yours. Greatness is indeed communicated
to some few of both sexes; but beauty is confined
to a more narrow compass: 'tis only in your sex,
'tis not shared by many, and its supreme perfection
is in you alone. And here, madam, I am proud that
I cannot flatter; you have reconciled the differing
judgments of mankind; for all men are equal in
their judgment of what is eminently best. The
prize of beauty was disputed only till you were seen;
but now all pretenders have withdrawn their claims:
there is no competition but for the second place;
even the fairest of our island, which is famed for
<a class="pgnm" id="page_099" name="page_099"></a>
beauties, not daring to commit their cause against
you to the suffrage of those, who most partially
adore them. Fortune has, indeed, but rendered
justice to so much excellence, in setting it so high
to public view; or, rather, Providence has done
justice to itself, in placing the most perfect workmanship
of heaven, where it may be admired by all
beholders. Had the sun and stars been seated
lower, their glory had not been communicated to
all at once, and the Creator had wanted so much of
his praise, as he had made your condition more obscure:
but he has placed you so near a crown, that
you add a lustre to it by your beauty. You are
joined to a prince, who only could deserve you;
whose conduct, courage, and success in war; whose
fidelity to his royal brother, whose love for his
country, whose constancy to his friends, whose
bounty to his servants, whose justice to merit, whose
inviolable truth, and whose magnanimity in all his
actions, seem to have been rewarded by heaven by
the gift of you. You are never seen but you are
blest; and I am sure you bless all those who see
you. We think not the day is long enough when
we behold you; and you are so much the business
of our souls, that while you are in sight, we can
neither look nor think on any else. There are no
eyes for other beauties; you only are present, and
the rest of your sex are but the unregarded parts
that fill your triumph. Our sight is so intent on
the object of its admiration, that our tongues have
not leisure even to praise you: for language seems
too low a thing to express your excellence; and our
souls are speaking so much within, that they despise
all foreign conversation. Every man, even
the dullest, is thinking more than the most eloquent
can teach him how to utter. Thus, madam, in the
midst of crowds, you reign in solitude; and are
<a class="pgnm" id="page_100" name="page_100"></a>
adored with the deepest veneration, that of silence.
'Tis true, you are above all mortal wishes; no man
desires impossibilities, because they are beyond the
reach of nature. To hope to be a god, is folly exalted
into madness; but, by the laws of our creation,
we are obliged to adore him, and are permitted to
love him too at human distance. 'Tis the nature of
perfection to be attractive, but the excellency of the
object refines the nature of the love. It strikes an
impression of awful reverence; 'tis indeed that love
which is more properly a zeal than passion. 'Tis
the rapture which anchorites find in prayer, when a
beam of the divinity shines upon them; that which
makes them despise all worldly objects; and yet 'tis
all but contemplation. They are seldom visited
from above, but a single vision so transports them,
that it makes up the happiness of their lives. Mortality
cannot bear it often: it finds them in the eagerness
and height of their devotion; they are speechless
for the time that it continues, and prostrate
and dead when it departs. That ecstacy had need
be strong, which, without any end, but that of admiration
has power enough to destroy all other
passions. You render mankind insensible to other
beauties, and have destroyed the empire of love in
a court which was the seat of his dominion. You
have subverted (may I dare to accuse you of it?)
even our fundamental laws; and reign absolute over
the hearts of a stubborn and free-born people, tenacious
almost to madness of their liberty. The
brightest and most victorious of our ladies make
daily complaints of revolted subjects, if they may
be said to be revolted, whose servitude is not accepted;
for your royal highness is too great, and
too just a monarch, either to want or to receive the
homage of rebellious fugitives. Yet, if some few
among the multitude continue stedfast to their first
<a class="pgnm" id="page_101" name="page_101"></a>
pretensions, 'tis an obedience so lukewarm and
languishing, that it merits not the name of passion;
their addresses are so faint, and their vows so hollow
to their sovereigns, that they seem only to
maintain their faith out of a sense of honour: they
are ashamed to desist, and yet grow careless to obtain.
Like despairing combatants, they strive
against you as if they had beheld unveiled the magical
shield of your Ariosto, which dazzled the beholders
with too much brightness. They can no
longer hold up their arms; they have read their destiny
in your eyes:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Splende lo scudo, a guisa di piropo;</p>
<p>E luce altra non &eacute; tanto lucente:</p>
<p>Cader in terra a lo splendor fu d'vopo,</p>
<p>Con gli occhi abbacinati, e senza mente.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And yet, madam, if I could find in myself the power
to leave this argument of your incomparable beauty,
I might turn to one which would equally oppress
me with its greatness; for your conjugal virtues
have deserved to be set as an example, to a less degenerate,
less tainted age. They approach so near
to singularity in ours, that I can scarcely make a
panegyric to your royal highness, without a satire
on many others. But your person is a paradise, and
your soul a cherubim within, to guard it. If the
excellence of the outside invite the beholders, the
majesty of your mind deters them from too bold
approaches, and turns their admiration into religion.
Moral perfections are raised higher by you in the
softer sex; as if men were of too coarse a mould for
heaven to work on, and that the image of divinity
could not be cast to likeness in so harsh a metal.
Your person is so admirable, that it can scarce receive
addition, when it shall be glorified: and your
soul, which shines through it, finds it of a substance
<a class="pgnm" id="page_102" name="page_102"></a>
so near her own, that she will be pleased to pass an
age within it, and to be confined to such a palace.</p>

<p>I know not how I am hurried back to my former
theme; I ought and purposed to have celebrated
those endowments and qualities of your mind, which
were sufficient, even without the graces of your
person, to render you, as you are, the ornament of
the court, and the object of wonder to three kingdoms.
But all my praises are but as a bull-rush
cast upon a stream; if they sink not, 'tis because
they are borne up by the strength of the current,
which supports their lightness; but they are carried
round again, and return on the eddy where they
first began. I can proceed no farther than your
beauty; and even on that too I have said so little,
considering the greatness of the subject, that, like
him who would lodge a bowl upon a precipice,
either my praise falls back, by the weakness of the
delivery, or stays not on the top, but rolls over, and
is lost on the other side. I intended this a dedication;
but how can I consider what belongs to myself,
when I have been so long contemplating on you!
Be pleased then, madam, to receive this poem, without
entitling so much excellency as yours, to the
faults and imperfections of so mean a writer; and
instead of being favourable to the piece, which merits
nothing, forgive the presumption of the author;
who is, with all possible veneration,</p>

Notwithstanding her husband's unpopularity, and her own attachment
to the Roman Catholic religion, her youth, beauty, and innocence
secured her from insult and slander during all the stormy
period which preceded her accession to the crown. Even Burnet,
reluctantly, admits the force of her charms, and the inoffensiveness
of her conduct. But her beauty produced a more lasting effect on
the young and gallant, than on that austere and stubborn partizan;
and its force must be allowed, since it was extolled even when Mary
was dethroned and exiled. Granville, Lord Lansdowne, has praised
her in "The Progress of Beauty;" and I cannot forbear transcribing
some of the verses, on account of the gallant spirit of the

<p>The beauty, which inspired the romantic and unchanging admiration
of Granville, may be allowed to justify some of the flights
of Dryden's panegyric. I fear enough will still remain to justify
the stricture of Johnson, who observes, that Dryden's dedication
is an "attempt to mingle earth and heaven, by praising human
excellence in the language of religion."</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO
MR DRYDEN,
ON HIS
POEM OF PARADISE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>Forgive me, awful poet, if a muse,</p>
<p>Whom artless nature did for plainness chuse,</p>
<p>In loose attire presents her humble thought,</p>
<p>Of this best poem that you ever wrought.</p>
<p>This fairest labour of your teeming brain</p>
<p>I would embrace, but not with flatt'ry stain.</p>
<p>Something I would to your vast virtue raise,</p>
<p>But scorn to daub it with a fulsome praise;</p>
<p>That would but blot the work I would commend,</p>
<p>And shew a court-admirer, not a friend.</p>
<p>To the dead bard your fame a little owes,</p>
<p>For Milton did the wealthy mine disclose,</p>
<p>And rudely cast what you could well dispose:</p>
<p>He roughly drew, on an old fashioned ground,</p>
<p>A chaos; for no perfect world was found,</p>
<p>Till through the heap your mighty genius shined:</p>
<p>He was the golden ore, which you refined.</p>
<p>He first beheld the beauteous rustic maid,</p>
<p>And to a place of strength the prize conveyed:</p>
<p>You took her thence; to court this virgin brought,</p>
<p>Drest her with gems, new weaved her hard-spun thought,</p>
<p>And softest language sweetest manners taught;</p>
<p>Till from a comet she a star doth rise,</p>
<p>Not to affright, but please, our wondering eyes.</p>
<p>Betwixt you both is trained a nobler piece,</p>
<p>Than e'er was drawn in Italy or Greece.</p>
<p>Thou from his source of thoughts even souls dost bring,</p>
<p>As smiling gods from sullen Saturn spring.</p>
<p>When night's dull mask the face of heaven does wear,</p>
<p>'Tis doubtful light, but here and there a star,</p>
<p><a class="pgnm" id="page_104" name="page_104"></a>
Which serves the dreadful shadows to display,</p>
<p>That vanish at the rising of the day;</p>
<p>But then bright robes the meadows all adorn,</p>
<p>And the world looks as it were newly born.</p>
<p>So, when your sense his mystic reason cleared,</p>
<p>The melancholy scene all gay appeared;</p>
<p>Now light leapt up, and a new glory smiled,</p>
<p>And all throughout was mighty, all was mild.</p>
<p>Before this palace, which thy wit did build,</p>
<p>Which various fancy did so gaudy gild,</p>
<p>And judgment has with solid riches filled,</p>
<p>My humbler muse begs she may sentry stand,</p>
<p>Amongst the rest that guard this Eden land.</p>
<p>But there's no need, for ev'n thy foes conspire</p>
<p>Thy praise, and, hating thee, thy work admire.</p>

<h3 class="chap">THE
AUTHOR'S APOLOGY
FOR
HEROIC POETRY, AND POETIC LICENCE.</h3>

<p>To satisfy the curiosity of those, who will give
themselves the trouble of reading the ensuing poem,
I think myself obliged to render them a reason why
I publish an opera which was never acted. In the
first place, I shall not be ashamed to own, that my
chiefest motive was, the ambition which I acknowledged
in the Epistle. I was desirous to lay at the
feet of so beautiful and excellent a princess, a work,
which, I confess, was unworthy her, but which, I
hope, she will have the goodness to forgive. I was
also induced to it in my own defence; many hundred
copies of it being dispersed abroad without
my knowledge, or consent: so that every one gathering
new faults, it became at length a libel
against me; and I saw, with some disdain, more
nonsense than either I, or as bad a poet, could have
crammed into it, at a month's warning; in which
time it was wholly written, and not since revised.
<a class="pgnm" id="page_106" name="page_106"></a>
After this, I cannot, without injury to the deceased
author of "Paradise Lost," but acknowledge, that
this poem has received its entire foundation, part of
the design, and many of the ornaments, from him.
What I have borrowed will be so easily discerned
from my mean productions, that I shall not need to
point the reader to the places: And truly I should
be sorry, for my own sake, that any one should take
the pains to compare them together; the original
being undoubtedly one of the greatest, most noble,
and most sublime poems, which either this age or
nation has produced. And though I could not refuse
the partiality of my friend, who is pleased to
commend me in his verses, I hope they will rather
be esteemed the effect of his love to me, than of
his deliberate and sober judgment. His genius is
able to make beautiful what he pleases: Yet, as he
has been too favourable to me, I doubt not but he
will hear of his kindness from many of our contemporaries
for we are fallen into an age of illiterate,
censorious, and detracting people, who, thus qualified,
set up for critics.</p>

<p>In the first place, I must take leave to tell them,
that they wholly mistake the nature of criticism,
who think its business is principally to find fault.
Criticism, as it was first instituted by Aristotle, was
meant a standard of judging well; the chiefest part
of which is, to observe those excellencies which
should delight a reasonable reader. If the design,
the conduct, the thoughts, and the expressions of a
poem, be generally such as proceed from a true genius
of poetry, the critic ought to pass his judgement
in favour of the author. It is malicious and
unmanly to snarl at the little lapses of a pen, from
which Virgil himself stands not exempted. Horace
acknowledges, that honest Homer nods sometimes:
<a class="pgnm" id="page_107" name="page_107"></a>
He is not equally awake in every line; but he leaves
it also as a standing measure for our judgments,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&mdash;Non, <i>ubi plura nitent in carmine, paucis</i></p>
<p>Offendi <i>maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,</i></p>
<p><i>Aut humana par&ugrave;m cavit natura.</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And Longinus, who was undoubtedly, after Aristotle
the greatest critic amongst the Greeks, in his
twenty-seventh chapter,
<span class="Greek" title="PERI HUPSOUS">
&Pi;&Epsilon;&Rho;&Iota;
'&Upsilon;&Psi;&Sigma;&Omicron;&Upsilon;&Sigma;
</span>,
has judiciously
preferred the sublime genius that sometimes errs,
to the middling or indifferent one, which makes
few faults, but seldom or never rises to any excellence.
He compares the first to a man of large
possessions, who has not leisure to consider of every
slight expence, will not debase himself to the management
of every trifle: Particular sums are not
laid out, or spared, to the greatest advantage in his
economy; but are sometimes suffered to run to
waste, while he is only careful of the main. On the
other side, he likens the mediocrity of wit, to one
of a mean fortune, who manages his store with extreme
frugality, or rather parsimony; but who, with
fear of running into profuseness, never arrives to
the magnificence of living. This kind of genius
writes indeed correctly. A wary man he is in grammar,
very nice as to solecism or barbarism, judges
to a hair of little decencies, knows better than any
man what is not to be written, and never hazards
himself so far as to fall, but plods on deliberately,
and, as a grave man ought, is sure to put his staff
before him. In short, he sets his heart upon it,
and with wonderful care makes his business sure;
that is, in plain English, neither to be blamed nor
praised.&mdash;I could, says my author, find out some
blemishes in Homer; and am perhaps as naturally
inclined to be disgusted at a fault as another man;
but, after all, to speak impartially, his failings are
<a class="pgnm" id="page_108" name="page_108"></a>
such, as are only marks of human frailty: they are
little mistakes, or rather negligences, which have
escaped his pen in the fervour of his writing; the
sublimity of his spirit carries it with me against his
carelessness; and though Apollonius his "Argonauts,"
and Theocritus his "Idyllia," are more free
from errors, there is not any man of so false a
judgment, who would chuse rather to have been
Apollonius or Theocritus, than Homer.</p>

<p>It is worth our consideration a little, to examine
how much these hypercritics in English poetry differ
from the opinion of the Greek and Latin judges
of antiquity; from the Italians and French, who
have succeeded them; and, indeed, from the general
taste and approbation of all ages. Heroic poetry,
which they condemn, has ever been esteemed,
and ever will be, the greatest work of human nature:
In that rank has Aristotle placed it; and Longinus
is so full of the like expressions, that he abundantly
confirms the other's testimony. Horace as
plainly delivers his opinion, and particularly praises
Homer in these verses:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Trojani Belli scriptorem, maxime Lolli,</p>
<p>Dum tu declamas Rom&aelig;, Pr&aelig;neste relegi:</p>
<p>Qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</p>
<p>Plenius ac melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And in another place, modestly excluding himself
from the number of poets, because he only writ
odes and satires, he tells you a poet is such an one,</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Cui mens divinior, atque os</p>
<p>Magna soniturum.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">Quotations are superfluous in an established truth;
otherwise I could reckon up, amongst the moderns,
all the Italian commentators on Aristotle's book of
poetry; and, amongst the French, the greatest of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_109" name="page_109"></a>
this age, Boileau and Rapin; the latter of which is
alone sufficient, were all other critics lost, to teach
anew the rules of writing. Any man, who will seriously
consider the nature of an epic poem, how it
agrees with that of poetry in general, which is to
instruct and to delight, what actions it describes,
and what persons they are chiefly whom it informs,
will find it a work which indeed is full of difficulty
in the attempt, but admirable when it is well performed.
I write not this with the least intention
to undervalue the other parts of poetry: for Comedy
is both excellently instructive, and extremely
pleasant; satire lashes vice into reformation, and
humour represents folly so as to render it ridiculous.
Many of our present writers are eminent in
both these kinds; and, particularly, the author of
the "Plain Dealer," whom I am proud to call my
friend, has obliged all honest and virtuous men, by
one of the most bold, most general, and most useful
satires, which has ever been presented on the
English theatre. I do not dispute the preference
of Tragedy; let every man enjoy his taste: but it is
unjust, that they, who have not the least notion of
heroic writing, should therefore condemn the pleasure
which others receive from it, because they
cannot comprehend it. Let them please their appetites
in eating what they like; but let them not
force their dish on all the table. They, who would
combat general authority with particular opinion,
must first establish themselves a reputation of understanding
better than other men. Are all the
flights of heroic poetry to be concluded bombast,
unnatural, and mere madness, because they are not
affected with their excellencies? It is just as reasonable
as to conclude there is no day, because a
blind man cannot distinguish of light and colours.
Ought they not rather, in modesty, to doubt of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_110" name="page_110"></a>
their own judgments, when they think this or that
expression in Homer, Virgil, Tasso, or Milton's
"Paradise," to be too far strained, than positively
to conclude, that it is all fustian, and mere nonsense?
It is true, there are limits to be set betwixt
the boldness and rashness of a poet; but he must
understand those limits, who pretends to judge as
well as he who undertakes to write: and he who
has no liking to the whole, ought, in reason, to be
excluded from censuring of the parts. He must be
a lawyer before he mounts the tribunal; and the
judicature of one court, too, does not qualify a man
to preside in another. He may be an excellent
pleader in the Chancery, who is not fit to rule the
Common Pleas. But I will presume for once to
tell them, that the boldest strokes of poetry, when
they are managed artfully, are those which most
delight the reader.</p>

<p>Virgil and Horace, the severest writers of the severest
age, have made frequent use of the hardest
metaphors, and of the strongest hyperboles; and in
this case the best authority is the best argument;
for generally to have pleased, and through all ages,
must bear the force of universal tradition. And if
you would appeal from thence to right reason, you
will gain no more by it in effect, than, first, to set
up your reason against those authors; and, secondly,
against all those who have admired them. You
must prove, why that ought not to have pleased,
which has pleased the most learned, and the most
judicious; and, to be thought knowing, you must
first put the fool upon all mankind. If you can
enter more deeply, than they have done, into the
causes and resorts of that which moves pleasure in
a reader, the field is open, you may be heard: But
those springs of human nature are not so easily discovered
by every superficial judge: It requires philosophy,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_111" name="page_111"></a>
as well as poetry, to sound the depth of all
the passions; what they are in themselves, and how
they are to be provoked: And in this science the
best poets have excelled. Aristotle raised the fabric
of his poetry from observation of those things,
in which Euripides, Sophocles, and &AElig;schylus pleased:
He considered how they raised the passions,
and thence has drawn rules for our imitation. From
hence have sprung the tropes and figures, for which
they wanted a name, who first practised them, and
succeeded in them. Thus I grant you, that the
knowledge of nature was the original rule; and that
all poets ought to study her, as well as Aristotle and
Horace, her interpreters. But then this also undeniably
follows, that those things, which delight all
ages, must have been an imitation of nature; which
is all I contend. Therefore is rhetoric made an
art; therefore the names of so many tropes and
figures were invented; because it was observed
they had such and such effect upon the audience.
Therefore catachreses and hyperboles have found
their place amongst them; not that they were to
be avoided, but to be used judiciously, and placed in
poetry, as heightenings and shadows are in painting,
to make the figure bolder, and cause it to stand off
to sight.</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Nec retia cervis</p>
<p>Ulla dolum meditantur;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">says Virgil in his Eclogues: and speaking of Leander,
in his Georgics,</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Nocte natat c&aelig;ca serus freta, quem super ingens</p>
<p>Porta tonat c&aelig;li, et scopulis illisa reclamant</p>
<p>&AElig;quora:</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">In both of these, you see, he fears not to give voice
and thought to things inanimate.</p>

<p>Will you arraign your master, Horace, for his hardness
<a class="pgnm" id="page_112" name="page_112"></a>
of expression, when he describes the death of
Cleopatra, and says she did&mdash;<i>asperos tractare serpentes,
ut atrum corpore combiberet cenenum,</i>&mdash;because
the body, in that action, performs what is proper to
the mouth?</p>

<p>As for hyperboles, I will neither quote Lucan, nor
Statius, men of an unbounded imagination, but who
often wanted the poize of judgment. The divine
Virgil was not liable to that exception; and yet he
describes Polyphemus thus:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Graditurque per &aelig;quor</p>
<p>Jam medium; necdum fluctus latera ardua tinxit.</p>
</div>

<p>In imitation of this place, our admirable Cowley
thus paints Goliah:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The valley, now, this monster seemed to fill;</p>
<p>And we, methought, looked up to him from our hill:</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">where the two words, <i>seemed</i> and <i>methought</i>, have
mollified the figure; and yet if they had not been
there, the fright of the Israelites might have excused
their belief of the giant's stature<a class="ftnt" href="#State_3-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>In the eighth of the &AElig;neids, Virgil paints the
swiftness of Camilla thus:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Ilia vel intact&aelig; segetis per summa volaret</p>
<p>Gramina, nec teneras cursu l&aelig;sisset aristas;</p>
<p>Vel mare per medium, fluctu suspensa tumenti,</p>
<p>Ferret iter, celeres nec tingeret &aelig;quore plantas.</p>
</div>

<p>You are not obliged, as in history, to a literal belief
of what the poet says; but you are pleased with
the image, without being cozened by the fiction.</p>

<p>Yet even in history, Longinus quotes Herodotus on
this occasion of hyperboles. The Lacedemonians,
says he, at the straits of Thermopyl&aelig;, defended themselves
<a class="pgnm" id="page_113" name="page_113"></a>
to the last extremity; and when their arms
failed them, fought it out with their nails and teeth;
till at length, (the Persians shooting continually
upon them) they lay buried under the arrows of
their enemies. It is not reasonable, (continues the
critic) to believe, that men could defend themselves
with their nails and teeth from an armed multitude;
nor that they lay buried under a pile of darts and
arrows; and yet there wants not probability for the
figure: because the hyperbole seems not to have
been made for the sake of the description; but rather
to have been produced from the occasion.</p>

<p>It is true, the boldness of the figures is to be hidden
sometimes by the address of the poet; that they may
work their effect upon the mind, without discovering
the art which caused it. And therefore they
are principally to be used in passion; when we
speak more warmly, and with more precipitation than
at other times: For then, <i>Si vis me flere, dolendum
est primum ipsi tibi;</i> the poet must put on the passion
he endeavours to represent: A man in such an
occasion is not cool enough, either to reason rightly,
or to talk calmly. Aggravations are then in their
proper places; interrogations, exclamations, hyperbata,
or a disordered connection of discourse, are
graceful there, because they are natural. The sum
of all depends on what before I hinted, that this
boldness of expression is not to be blamed, if it be
managed by the coolness and discretion which is
necessary to a poet.</p>

<p>Yet before I leave this subject, I cannot but take
notice how disingenuous our adversaries appear: All
that is dull, insipid, languishing, and without sinews,
in a poem, they call an imitation of nature: They
only offend our most equitable judges, who think
beyond them; and lively images and elocution are
never to be forgiven.</p>

<p><a class="pgnm" id="page_114" name="page_114"></a>
What fustian, as they call it, have I heard these
gentlemen find out in Mr Cowley's Odes! I acknowledge
myself unworthy to defend so excellent
an author, neither have I room to do it here; only
in general I will say, that nothing can appear more
beautiful to me, than the strength of those images
which they condemn.</p>

<p>Imaging is, in itself, the very height and life of
poetry. It is, as Longinus describes it, a discourse,
which, by a kind of enthusiasm, or extraordinary
emotion of the soul, makes it seem to us, that we
behold those things which the poet paints, so as to
be pleased with them, and to admire them.</p>

<p>If poetry be imitation, that part of it must needs
be best, which describes most lively our actions and
passions; our virtues and our vices; our follies and
our humours: For neither is comedy without its
part of imaging; and they who do it best are certainly
the most excellent in their kind. This is too
plainly proved to be denied: But how are poetical
fictions, how are hippocentaurs and chimeras, or
how are angels and immaterial substances to be imaged;
which, some of them, are things quite out
of nature; others, such whereof we can have no notion?
This is the last refuge of our adversaries; and
more than any of them have yet had the wit to object
against us. The answer is easy to the first part
of it: The fiction of some beings which are not in
nature, (second notions, as the logicians call them)
has been founded on the conjunction of two natures,
which have a real separate being. So hippocentaurs
were imaged, by joining the natures of a man and
horse together; as Lucretius tells us, who has used
this word of <i>image</i> oftener than any of the poets:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Nam cert&egrave; ex vivo centauri non fit imago,</p>
<p>Nulla fuit quoniam talis natura animai:</p>
<p>Ver&ugrave;m ubi equi atque hominis, casu, convenit imago,</p>
<p>H&aelig;rescit facil&egrave; extempl&ograve;, <span style="font-style: normal">&amp;c.</span></p>
</div>

<p><a class="pgnm" id="page_115" name="page_115"></a>
The same reason may also be alleged for chimeras
and the rest. And poets may be allowed the like
liberty, for describing things which really exist not,
if they are founded on popular belief. Of this nature
are fairies, pigmies, and the extraordinary effects
of magic; for it is still an imitation, though of other
men's fancies: and thus are Shakespeare's "Tempest,"
his "Midsummer Night's Dream," and Ben Jonson's
"Masque of Witches" to be defended. For immaterial
substances, we are authorised by Scripture in their
description: and herein the text accommodates itself
to vulgar apprehension, in giving angels the
likeness of beautiful young men. Thus, after the
pagan divinity, has Homer drawn his gods with human
faces: and thus we have notions of things
above us, by describing them like other beings more
within our knowledge.</p>

<p>I wish I could produce any one example of excellent
imaging in all this poem. Perhaps I cannot;
but that which comes nearest it, is in these four
lines, which have been sufficiently canvassed by my
well-natured censors:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Seraph and cherub, careless of their charge,</p>
<p>And wanton, in full ease now live at large:</p>
<p>Unguarded leave the passes of the sky,</p>
<p>And all dissolved in hallelujahs lie.</p>
</div>

<p>I have heard (says one of them) of anchovies <i>dissolved</i>
in sauce; but never of an angel <i>in hallelujahs.</i>
A mighty witticism! (if you will pardon a
new word,) but there is some difference between a
laugher and a critic. He might have burlesqued
Virgil too, from whom I took the image. <i>Invadunt
urbem, somno vinoque sepultam.</i> A city's being buried,
is just as proper on occasion, as an angel's being dissolved
in ease, and songs of triumph. Mr Cowley
lies as open too in many places:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Where their vast courts the mother waters keep, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><a class="pgnm" id="page_116" name="page_116"></a>
For if the mass of waters be the mothers, then their
daughters, the little streams, are bound, in all good
manners, to make courtesy to them, and ask them
blessing. How easy it is to turn into ridicule the best
descriptions, when once a man is in the humour of
laughing, till he wheezes at his own dull jest! but
an image, which is strongly and beautifully set before
the eyes of the reader, will still be poetry, when
the merry fit is over, and last when the other is
forgotten.</p>

<p>I promised to say somewhat of Poetic Licence, but
have in part anticipated my discourse already. Poetic
Licence, I take to be the liberty which poets have
assumed to themselves, in all ages, of speaking things
in verse, which are beyond the severity of prose.
It is that particular character, which distinguishes
and sets the bounds betwixt <i>oratio soluta</i>, and
poetry. This, as to what regards the thought, or
imagination of a poet, consists in fiction: but then
those thoughts must be expressed; and here arise
two other branches of it; for if this licence be included
in a single word, it admits of tropes; if in a
sentence or proposition, of figures; both which are
of a much larger extent, and more forcibly to be
used in verse than prose. This is that birth-right
which is derived to us from our great forefathers,
even from Homer down to Ben; and they, who
would deny it to us, have, in plain terms, the fox's
quarrel to the grapes&mdash;they cannot reach it.</p>

<p>How far these liberties are to be extended, I will
not presume to determine here, since Horace does
not. But it is certain that they are to be varied, according
to the language and age in which an author
writes. That which would be allowed to a Grecian
poet, Martial tells you, would not be suffered in a
Roman; and it is evident, that the English does
more nearly follow the strictness of the latter, than
the freedoms of the former. Connection of epithets,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_117" name="page_117"></a>
or the conjunction of two words in one, are frequent
and elegant in the Greek, which yet Sir Philip Sidney,
and the translator of Du Bartas, have unluckily
attempted in the English; though this, I confess,
is not so proper an instance of poetic licence, as it
is of variety of idiom in languages.</p>

<p>Horace a little explains himself on this subject of
<i>Licentia Poetica</i>, in these verses:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Pictoribus atque Poetis</p>
<p>Quidlibet audendi semper fuit &aelig;qua potestas: ...</p>
<p>Sed non, ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut</p>
<p>Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus h&aelig;di.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">He would have a poem of a piece; not to begin
with one thing, and end with another: He restrains
it so far, that thoughts of an unlike nature ought
not to be joined together. That were indeed to make
a chaos. He taxed not Homer, nor the divine Virgil,
for interesting their gods in the wars of Troy
and Italy; neither, had he now lived, would he
have taxed Milton, as our false critics have presumed
to do, for his choice of a supernatural argument;
but he would have blamed my author, who was a
Christian, had he introduced into his poem heathen
deities, as Tasso is condemned by Rapin on the like
occasion; and as Camo&euml;ns, the author of the "Lusiads,"
ought to be censured by all his readers, when
he brings in Bacchus and Christ into the same adventure
of his fable.</p>

<p>From that which has been said, it may be
collected, that the definition of wit (which has
been so often attempted, and ever unsuccessfully
by many poets,) is only this: That it is a propriety
of thoughts and words; or, in other terms,
thoughts and words elegantly adapted to the subject.
If our critics will join issue on this definition,
that we may <i>convenire in aliquo tertio</i>; if they
will take it as a granted principle, it will be easy to
<a class="pgnm" id="page_118" name="page_118"></a>
put an end to this dispute. No man will disagree
from another's judgment concerning the dignity of
style in heroic poetry; but all reasonable men will
conclude it necessary, that sublime subjects ought
to be adorned with the sublimest, and consequently
often, with the most figurative expressions. In the
mean time I will not run into their fault of imposing
my opinions on other men, any more than I
would my writings on their taste: I have only laid
down, and that superficially enough, my present
thoughts; and shall be glad to be taught better by
those who pretend to reform our poetry.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Adam.</span> What am I? or from whence? For that I am<span class="sdr">[Rising.</span><br />
I know, because I think; but whence I came,<br />
Or how this frame of mine began to be,<br />
What other being can disclose to me?<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_127" name="page_127"></a>
I move, I see, I speak, discourse, and know;<br />
Though now I am, I was not always so.<br />
Then that, from which I was, must be before,<br />
Whom, as my spring of being, I adore.<br />
How full of ornament is all I view,<br />
In all its parts! and seems as beautiful as new:<br />
O goodly-ordered work! O Power Divine,<br />
Of thee I am, and what I am is thine!</p>

<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">Raphael</span> descends to <span class="cnm">Adam,</span> in a cloud.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raphael.</span> First of mankind, made o'er the world to reign,<br />
Whose fruitful loins an unborn kind contain,<br />
Well hast thou reasoned: Of himself is none<br />
But that Eternal Infinite and One,<br />
Who never did begin, who ne'er can end;<br />
On Him all beings, as their source, depend.<br />
We first, who of his image most partake,<br />
Whom he all spirit, immortal, pure, did make;<br />
Man next; whose race, exalted, must supply<br />
The place of those, who, falling, lost the sky.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Adam.</span> Bright minister of heaven, sent here below<br />
To me, who but begin to think and know;<br />
If such could fall from bliss, who knew and saw,<br />
By near admission, their creator's law,<br />
What hopes have I, from heaven remote so far,<br />
To keep those laws, unknowing when I err?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raphael.</span> Right reason's law to every human heart<br />
The Eternal, as his image, will impart:<br />
This teaches to adore heaven's Majesty;<br />
In prayer and praise does all devotion lie:<br />
So doing, thou and all thy race are blest.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Adam.</span> Of every creeping thing, of bird, and beast,<br />
I see the kinds: In pairs distinct they go;<br />
The males their loves, their lovers females know:<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_128" name="page_128"></a>
Thou nam'st a race which must proceed from me,<br />
Yet my whole species in myself I see:<br />
A barren sex, and single, of no use,<br />
But full of forms which I can ne'er produce.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raphael.</span> Think not the Power, who made thee thus, can find<br />
No way like theirs to propagate thy kind:<br />
Meantime, live happy in thyself alone;<br />
Like him who, single, fills the etherial throne.<br />
To study nature will thy time employ:<br />
Knowledge and innocence are perfect joy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Adam.</span> If solitude were best, the All-wise above<br />
Had made no creature for himself to love.<br />
I add not to the power he had before;<br />
Yet to make me, extends his goodness more.<br />
He would not be alone, who all things can;<br />
But peopled heaven with angels, earth with man.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raphael.</span> As man and angels to the Deity,<br />
So all inferior creatures are to thee.<br />
Heaven's greatness no society can bear;<br />
Servants he made, and those thou want'st not here.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Adam.</span> Why did he reason in my soul implant,<br />
And speech, the effect of reason? To the mute,<br />
My speech is lost; my reason to the brute.<br />
Love and society more blessings bring<br />
To them, the slaves, than power to me, their king.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raphael.</span> Thus far to try thee; but to heaven 'twas known,<br />
It was not best for man to be alone;<br />
An equal, yet thy subject, is designed,<br />
For thy soft hours, and to unbend thy mind.<br />
Thy stronger soul shall her weak reason sway;<br />
And thou, through love, her beauty shalt obey;<br />
Thou shalt secure her helpless sex from harms,<br />
And she thy cares shall sweeten with her charms.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_129" name="page_129"></a>
<span class="cnm">Adam.</span> What more can heaven bestow, or man require?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raphael.</span> Yes, he can give beyond thy own desire.<br />
A mansion is provided thee, more fair<br />
Than this, and worthy heaven's peculiar care:<br />
Not framed of common earth, nor fruits, nor flowers<br />
Of vulgar growth, but like celestial bowers:<br />
The soil luxuriant, and the fruit divine,<br />
Where golden apples on green branches shine,<br />
And purple grapes dissolve into immortal wine;<br />
For noon-day's heat are closer arbours made,<br />
And for fresh evening air the opener glade.<br />
Ascend; and, as we go,<br />
More wonders thou shalt know.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Adam.</span> And, as we go, let earth and heaven above<br />
Sound our great Maker's power, and greater love.
<span class="sdr">[They ascend to soft music, and a song is sung.</span></p>

And thou, black empire of the nether world,<br />
How dearly have I bought you! But, 'tis past;<br />

Those envied skies again, which I have lost.<br />
But stay; far off I see a chariot driven,<br />
Flaming with beams, and in it Uriel,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Uriel.</span> On yonder mount; thou see'st it fenced with rocks,<br />
And round the ascent a theatre of trees,<br />
A sylvan scene, which, rising by degrees,<br />
Leads up the eye below, nor gluts the sight<br />
With one full prospect, but invites by many,<br />
To view at last the whole: There his abode,<br />

<h3 class="chap">AURENG-ZEBE.</h3>

<p>"Aureng-Zebe," or the Ornament of the Throne, for such
is the interpretation of his name, was the last descendant of Timur,
who enjoyed the plenitude of authority originally vested in the Emperor
of India. His father, Sha-Jehan, had four sons, to each of
whom he delegated the command of a province. Dara-Sha, the eldest,
superintended the district of Delhi, and remained near his father's
person; Sultan-Sujah was governor of Bengal, Aureng-Zebe of
the Decan, and Morat Bakshi of Guzerat. It happened, that
Sha-Jehan being exhausted by the excesses of the Haram, a report
of his death became current in the provinces, and proved
the signal for insurrection and discord among his children. Morat
Bakshi possessed himself of Surat, after a long siege, and Sultan-Sujah,
having declared himself independent in Bengal, advanced
as far as Lahor, with a large army. Dara-Sha, the legitimate
successor of the crown, was the only son of Sha-Jehan, who preferred
filial duty to the prospect of aggrandisement. He dispatched
an army against Sultan-Sujah, checked his progress, and
compelled him to retreat. But Aureng-Zebe, the third and most
wily of the brethren, had united his forces to those of Morat Bakshi,
and advancing against Dara-Sha, totally defeated him, and dissipated
his army. Aureng-Zebe availed himself of the military reputation
and treasures, acquired by his success, to seduce the
forces of Morat Bakshi, whom he had pretended to assist, and, seizing
upon his person at a banquet, imprisoned him in a strong
fortress. Meanwhile, he advanced towards Agra, where his father
had sought refuge, still affecting to believe that the old emperor
was dead. The more pains Sha-Jehan took to contradict
this report, the more obstinate was Aureng-Zebe in refusing to
believe that he was still alive. And, although the emperor dispatched
his most confidential servants to assure his dutiful son
that he was yet in being, the incredulity of Aureng-Zebe could
only be removed by a personal interview, the issue of which was
Sha-Jehan's imprisonment and speedy death. During these transactions
Dara-Sha, who, after his defeat, had fled with his treasures
to Lahor, again assembled an army, and advanced against the
conqueror; but, being deserted by his allies, defeated by Aureng-Zebe,
and betrayed by an Omrah, whom he trusted in his flight,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_170" name="page_170"></a>
he was delivered up to his brother, and by his command assassinated.
Aureng-Zebe now assumed the throne, and advanced against
Sultan-Sujah, his sole remaining brother; he seduced his chief
commanders, routed the forces who remained faithful, and drove
him out of Bengal into the Pagan countries adjacent, where, after
several adventures, he perished miserably in the mountains.
Aureng-Zebe also murdered one or two nephews, and a few
other near relations; but, in expiation of his complicated crimes,
renounced the use of flesh, fish, and wine, living only upon barley-bread
vegetables, and confections, although scrupling no excesses
by which he could extend and strengthen his usurped power<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_1-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Dr Johnson has supposed, that, in assuming for his subject a living
prince, Dryden incurred some risque; as, should Aureng-Zebe
have learned and resented the freedom, our Indian trade was
exposed to the consequences of his displeasure. It may, however, be
safely doubted, whether a monarch, who had actually performed
the achievements above narrated, would have been scandalized
by those imputed to him in the text. In other respects, the distance
and obscurity of the events gave a poet the same authority
over them, as if they had occurred in the annals of past ages; a
circumstance in which Dryden's age widely differed from ours, when
so much has our intimacy increased with the Oriental world, that
the transactions of Delhi are almost as familiar to us as those of
Paris.</p>

<p>The tragedy of "Aureng-Zebe" is introduced by the poet's declaration
in the prologue, that his taste for heroic plays was now
upon the wane:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>But he has now another taste of wit;</p>
<p>And, to confess a truth, though out of time,</p>
<p>Grows weary of his long-loved mistress, Rhyme.</p>
<p>Passion's too fierce to be in fetters bound,</p>
<p>And nature flies him, like enchanted ground,</p>
<p>What verse can do, he has performed in this,</p>
<p>Which he presumes the most correct of his.</p>
</div>

<p>Agreeably to what might be expected from this declaration, the
verse used in "Aureng-Zebe" is of that kind which may be most
easily applied to the purposes of ordinary dialogue. There is
much less of ornate structure and emphatic swell, than occurs in
the speeches of Almanzor and Maximin; and Dryden, though
late, seems to have at length discovered, that the language of true
passion is inconsistent with that regular modulation, to maintain
<a class="pgnm" id="page_171" name="page_171"></a>
which, the actor must mouth each couplet in a sort of recitative.
The ease of the verse in "Aureng-Zebe," although managed with
infinite address, did not escape censure. In the "just remonstrance
of affronted <i>That</i>," transmitted to the Spectator, the offended
conjunction is made to plead, "What great advantage was <i>I</i> of
to Mr Dryden, in his "Indian Emperor?"</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>You force me still to answer you in <i>that,</i></p>
<p>To furnish out a rhime to Morat.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And what a poor figure would Mr Bayes have made, without his
<i>Egad, and all that</i>?" But, by means of this easy flow of versification
in which the rhime is sometimes almost lost by the pause
being transferred to the middle of the line, Dryden, in some measure
indemnified himself for his confinement, and, at least, muffled
the clank of his fetters. Still, however, neither the kind of verse,
nor perhaps the poet, himself, were formed for expressing rapid
and ardent dialogue; and the beauties of "Aureng-Zebe" will be
found chiefly to consist in strains of didactic morality, or solemn
meditation. The passage, descriptive of life, has been distinguished
by all the critics, down to Dr Johnson:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> When I consider life, 'tis all a cheat;<br />
Yet, fooled with hope, men favour the deceit;<br />
Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay:<br />
To-morrow's falser than the former day;<br />
Lies worse; and, while it says, We shall be blest<br />
With some new joys, cuts off what we possest.<br />
Strange cozenage! none would live past years again,<br />
Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain;<br />
And from the dregs of life think to receive<br />
What the first sprightly running could not give.<br />
I'm tired with waiting for this chemic gold,<br />
Which fools us young, and beggars us when old.</p>
</div>

<p>Nor is the answer of Nourmahal inferior in beauty:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Nour.</span> 'Tis not for nothing that we life pursue;<br />
It pays our hopes with something still that's new;<br />
Each day's a mistress, unenjoyed before;<br />
Like travellers, we're pleased with seeing more.<br />
Did you but know what joys your way attend,<br />
You would not hurry to your journey's end.</p>
</div>

<p>It might be difficult to point out a passage in English poetry,
in which so common and melancholy a truth is expressed in such
beautiful verse, varied with such just illustration. The declamation
<a class="pgnm" id="page_172" name="page_172"></a>
on virtue, also, has great merit, though, perhaps, not equal to
that on the vanity of life:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> How vain is virtue, which directs our ways<br />
Through certain danger to uncertain praise!<br />
Barren, and airy name! thee fortune flies,<br />
With thy lean train, the pious and the wise.<br />
Heaven takes thee at thy word, without regard;<br />
And let's thee poorly be thy own reward.<br />
The world is made for the bold impious man,<br />
Who stops at nothing, seizes all he can.<br />
Justice to merit does weak aid afford;<br />
She trusts her balance, and neglects her sword.<br />
Virtue is nice to take what's not her own;<br />
And, while she long consults, the prize is gone.</p>
</div>

<p>To this account may be added the following passage from Davies'
"Dramatic Miscellanies."</p>

<p>"Dryden's last and most perfect rhiming tragedy was 'Aureng-Zebe.'
In this play, the passions are strongly depicted, the characters
well discriminated, and the diction more familiar and dramatic
than in any of his preceding pieces. Hart and Mohun greatly
distinguished themselves in the characters of Aureng-Zebe, and the
Old Emperor. Mrs Marshall was admired in Nourmahal, and
Kynaston has been much extolled by Cibber, for his happy expression
of the arrogant and savage fierceness in Morat. Booth, in
some part of this character, says the same critical historian, was
too tame, from an apprehension of raising the mirth of the audience
improperly.</p>

<p>"Though I pay great deference to Cibber's judgment, yet I am
not sure whether Booth was not in the right. And I cannot help
approving the answer which this actor gave to one, who told him,
he was surprised, that he neglected to give a spirited turn to the
passage in question:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Nour.</span> 'Twill not be safe to let him live an hour.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> I'll do it to shew my arbitrary power.</p>
</div>

<p>"'Sir,' said Booth, 'it was not through negligence, but by
design, that I gave no spirit to that ludicrous bounce of Morat. I
know very well, that a laugh of approbation may be obtained from
the understanding few, but there is nothing more dangerous than
exciting the laugh of simpletons, who know not where to stop.
The majority is not the wisest part of the audience, and therefore
I will run no hazard.'</p>

<p>"The court greatly encouraged the play of 'Aureng-Zebe.'
The author tells us, in his dedication, that Charles II. altered an
incident in the plot, and pronounced it to be the best of all Dryden's
<a class="pgnm" id="page_173" name="page_173"></a>
tragedies. It was revived at Drury-Lane about the year
1726, with the public approbation: The Old Emperor, Mills;
Wilkes, Aureng-Zebe; Booth, Morat; Indamora, Mrs Oldfield;
Melesinda, the first wife of Theophilus Cibber, a very pleasing actress,
in person agreeable, and in private life unblemished. She
died in 1733."&mdash;Vol. I. p. 157.</p>

<p>The introduction states all that can be said in favour of the
management of the piece; and it is somewhat amusing to see the
anxiety which Dryden uses to justify the hazardous experiment, of
ascribing to emperors and princesses the language of nature and of
passion. He appears with difficulty to have satisfied himself, that
the decorum of the scene was not as peremptory as the etiquette of
a court. "Aureng-Zebe" was received with the applause to which
it is certainly entitled. It was acted and printed in 1676.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
JOHN,<br />
EARL OF MULGRAVE,<br />
GENTLEMAN OF HIS MAJESTY'S BED-CHAMBER,<br />
AND KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER
OF THE GARTER<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noind smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>It is a severe reflection which Montaigne has made
on princes, that we ought not, in reason, to have
any expectations of favour from them; and that it is
kindness enough, if they leave us in possession of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_175" name="page_175"></a>
our own. The boldness of the censure shows the
free spirit of the author: And the subjects of England
may justly congratulate to themselves, that both
the nature of our government, and the clemency of
our king, secure us from any such complaint. I, in
particular, who subsist wholly by his bounty, am
obliged to give posterity a far other account of my
<a class="pgnm" id="page_176" name="page_176"></a>
royal master, than what Montaigne has left of his.
Those accusations had been more reasonable, if they
had been placed on inferior persons: For in all
courts, there are too many, who make it their business
to ruin wit; and Montaigne, in other places,
tells us, what effects he found of their good natures.
He describes them such, whose ambition, lust, or
private interest, seem to be the only end of their
creation. If good accrue to any from them, it is
only in order to their own designs: conferred most
commonly on the base and infamous; and never
given, but only happening sometimes on well-deservers.
Dulness has brought them to what they
<a class="pgnm" id="page_177" name="page_177"></a>
are; and malice secures them in their fortunes.
But somewhat of specious they must have, to recommend
themselves to princes, (for folly will not
easily go down in its own natural form with discerning
judges,) and diligence in waiting is their
gilding of the pill; for that looks like love, though
it is only interest. It is that which gains them
their advantage over witty men; whose love of liberty
and ease makes them willing too often to discharge
their burden of attendance on these officious
gentlemen. It is true, that the nauseousness
of such company is enough to disgust a reasonable
man; when he sees, he can hardly approach
greatness, but as a moated castle; he must first
pass through the mud and filth with which it is
encompassed. These are they, who, wanting wit,
affect gravity, and go by the name of solid men;
and a solid man is, in plain English, a solid, solemn
fool. Another disguise they have, (for fools,
as well as knaves, take other names, and pass by
an <i>alias</i>) and that is, the title of honest fellows.
But this honesty of theirs ought to have many
grains for its allowance; for certainly they are no
farther honest, than they are silly: They are naturally
mischievous to their power; and if they
speak not maliciously, or sharply, of witty men,
it is only because God has not bestowed on them
the gift of utterance. They fawn and crouch to
men of parts, whom they cannot ruin; quote their
wit when they are present, and, when they are absent
steal their jests; but to those who are under
them, and whom they can crush with ease, they
shew themselves in their natural antipathy; there
they treat wit like the common enemy, and giving
no more quarter, than a Dutchman would to an
English vessel in the Indies; they strike sail where
<a class="pgnm" id="page_178" name="page_178"></a>
they know they shall be mastered, and murder where
they can with safety.</p>

<p>This, my lord, is the character of a courtier without
wit; and therefore that which is a satire to other
men, must be a panegyric to your lordship, who
are a master of it. If the least of these reflections
could have reached your person, no necessity of
mine could have made me to have sought so earnestly,
and so long, to have cultivated your kindness.
As a poet, I cannot but have made some observations
on mankind; the lowness of my fortune has
not yet brought me to flatter vice; and it is my duty
to give testimony to virtue. It is true, your lordship
is not of that nature, which either seeks a commendation,
or wants it. Your mind has always
been above the wretched affectation of popularity.
A popular man is, in truth, no better than a prostitute
to common fame, and to the people. He lies
down to every one he meets for the hire of praise;
and his humility is only a disguised ambition. Even
Cicero himself, whose eloquence deserved the admiration
of mankind, yet, by his insatiable thirst
of fame, he has lessened his character with succeeding
ages; his action against Catiline may be said
to have ruined the consul, when it saved the city;
for it so swelled his soul, which was not truly great,
that ever afterwards it was apt to be over-set with
vanity. And this made his virtue so suspected by
his friends, that Brutus, whom of all men he adored,
refused him a place in his conspiracy. A modern
wit has made this observation on him; that, coveting
to recommend himself to posterity, he begged
it as an alms of all his friends, the historians, to remember
his consulship: And observe, if you please,
the oddness of the event; all their histories are
lost, and the vanity of his request stands yet recorded
in his own writings. How much more great and
<a class="pgnm" id="page_179" name="page_179"></a>
manly in your lordship, is your contempt of popular
applause, and your retired virtue, which shines only
to a few; with whom you live so easily and freely,
that you make it evident, you have a soul which is
capable of all the tenderness of friendship, and that
you only retire yourself from those, who are not
capable of returning it. Your kindness, where you
have once placed it, is inviolable; and it is to that
only I attribute my happiness in your love. This
makes me more easily forsake an argument, on
which I could otherwise delight to dwell; I mean,
your judgment in your choice of friends; because I
have the honour to be one. After which I am sure
you will more easily permit me to be silent, in the
care you have taken of my fortune; which you have
rescued, not only from the power of others, but
from my worst of enemies, my own modesty and
laziness; which favour, had it been employed on
a more deserving subject, had been an effect of justice
in your nature; but, as placed on me, is only
charity. Yet, withal, it is conferred on such a man,
as prefers your kindness itself, before any of its consequences;
and who values, as the greatest of your
favours, those of your love, and of your conversation.
From this constancy to your friends, I might
reasonably assume, that your resentments would be
as strong and lasting, if they were not restrained by
a nobler principle of good nature and generosity;
for certainly, it is the same composition of mind,
the same resolution and courage, which makes the
greatest friendships, and the greatest enmities.
And he, who is too lightly reconciled, after high
provocations, may recommend himself to the world
for a Christian, but I should hardly trust him for
a friend. The Italians have a proverb to that purpose,
"To forgive the first time, shows me a good
Catholic; the second time, a fool." To this firmness
in all your actions, though you are wanting in no
<a class="pgnm" id="page_180" name="page_180"></a>
other ornaments of mind and body, yet to this I
principally ascribe the interest your merits have acquired
you in the royal family. A prince, who is
constant to himself, and steady in all his undertakings;
one with whom that character of Horace will
agree,</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Si fractus illabatur orbis,</p>
<p>Impavidum ferient ruin&aelig;<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-2">[2]</a>;&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">such an one cannot but place an esteem, and repose
a confidence on him, whom no adversity, no change
of courts, no bribery of interests, or cabals of factions,
or advantages of fortune, can remove from the
solid foundations of honour and fidelity:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, amores</p>
<p>Abstulit; ille habeat secum, servetque sepulcro.</p>
</div>

<p>How well your lordship will deserve that praise,
I need no inspiration to foretell. You have already
left no room for prophecy: Your early undertakings
have been such, in the service of your king and
country, when you offered yourself to the most
dangerous employment, that of the sea; when you
chose to abandon those delights, to which your
youth and fortune did invite you, to undergo the
hazards, and, which was worse, the company of common
seamen, that you have made it evident, you
will refuse no opportunity of rendering yourself useful
to the nation, when either your courage or conduct
shall be required<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-3">[3]</a>. The same zeal and faithfulness
<a class="pgnm" id="page_181" name="page_181"></a>
continue in your blood, which animated one
of your noble ancestors to sacrifice his life in the
quarrels of his sovereign<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-4">[4]</a>; though, I hope, both for
your sake, and for the public tranquillity, the same
occasion will never be offered to your lordship, and
that a better destiny will attend you. But I make
haste to consider you as abstracted from a court,
which (if you will give me leave to use a term of
logic) is only an adjunct, not a propriety of happiness.
The academics, I confess, were willing to admit
the goods of fortune into their notion of felicity;
but I do not remember, that any of the sects of
old philosophers did ever leave a room for greatness.
Neither am I formed to praise a court, who admire
and covet nothing, but the easiness and quiet of
retirement. I naturally withdraw my sight from a
precipice; and, admit the prospect be never so large
and goodly, can take no pleasure even in looking on
the downfal, though I am secure from the danger.
<a class="pgnm" id="page_182" name="page_182"></a>
Methinks, there is something of a malignant joy in
that excellent description of Lucretius;</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Suave, mari magno turbantibus &aelig;quora ventis,</p>
<p>E terr&acirc; magnum alterius spectare laborem;</p>
<p>Non quia vexari quenquam est jucunda voluptas,</p>
<p>Sed, quibus ipse malis careas, quia cernere suave est.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">I am sure his master Epicurus, and my better master
Cowley, preferred the solitude of a garden, and
the conversation of a friend, to any consideration,
so much as a regard, of those unhappy people, whom,
in our own wrong, we call the great. True greatness,
if it be any where on earth, is in a private virtue;
removed from the notion of pomp and vanity, confined
to a contemplation of itself, and centering on
itself:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Omnis enim per se Div&ucirc;m natura necesse est</p>
<p>Immortali &aelig;vo summ&acirc; cum pace fruatur;</p>
<p>&mdash;cur&acirc; semota, metuque,</p>
<p>Ipsa suis pollens opibus<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-5">[5]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">If this be not the life of a deity, because it cannot
consist with Providence, it is, at least, a god-like
life. I can be contented, (and I am sure I have your
lordship of my opinion) with an humbler station in
the temple of virtue, than to be set on the pinnacle
of it:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<a class="pgnm" id="page_183" name="page_183"></a>
<p>Despicere unde queas alios, passimque videre</p>
<p>Errare, atque viam palantes qu&aelig;rere vit&aelig;.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">The truth is, the consideration of so vain a creature
as man, is not worth our pains. I have fool enough
at home, without looking for it abroad; and am a
sufficient theatre to myself of ridiculous actions,
without expecting company, either in a court, a
town, or a play-house. It is on this account that I
am weary with drawing the deformities of life, and
lazars of the people, where every figure of imperfection
more resembles me than it can do others.
If I must be condemned to rhyme, I should find
some ease in my change of punishment. I desire
to be no longer the Sisyphus of the stage; to roll
up a stone with endless labour, (which, to follow
the proverb, gathers no moss) and which is perpetually
falling down again. I never thought myself
very fit for an employment, where many of my predecessors
have excelled me in all kinds; and some
of my contemporaries, even in my own partial judgement
have outdone me in Comedy. Some little
hopes I have yet remaining, and those too, considering
my abilities, may be vain, that I may make
the world some part of amends, for many ill plays,
by an heroic poem. Your lordship has been long
acquainted with my design; the subject of which
you know is great, the story English, and neither
too far distant from the present age, nor too near
approaching it. Such it is in my opinion, that I
could not have wished a nobler occasion to do honour
by it to my king, my country, and my friends;
most of our ancient nobility being concerned in the
action<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-6">[6]</a>. And your lordship has one particular reason
<a class="pgnm" id="page_184" name="page_184"></a>
to promote this undertaking, because you were
the first who gave me the opportunity of discoursing
it to his majesty, and his royal highness: They
were then pleased, both to commend the design,
and to encourage it by their commands. But the
unsettledness of my condition has hitherto put a
stop to my thoughts concerning it. As I am no
successor to Homer in his wit, so neither do I desire
to be in his poverty. I can make no rhapsodies
nor go a begging at the Grecian doors, while
I sing the praises of their ancestors. The times of
Virgil please me better, because he had an Augustus
for his patron; and, to draw the allegory nearer
you, I am sure I shall not want a Mec&aelig;nas with
him. It is for your lordship to stir up that remembrance
in his majesty, which his many avocations
of business have caused him, I fear, to lay aside;
and, as himself and his royal brother are the heroes
of the poem, to represent to them the images of
their warlike predecessors; as Achilles is said to be
roused to glory, with the sight of the combat before
the ships. For my own part, I am satisfied to
have offered the design, and it may be to the advantage
of my reputation to have it refused me.</p>

<p>In the mean time, my lord, I take the confidence
to present you with a tragedy, the characters of
which are the nearest to those of an heroic poem.
It was dedicated to you in my heart, before it was
presented on the stage. Some things in it have
passed your approbation, and many your amendment.
You were likewise pleased to recommend
it to the king's perusal, before the last hand was added
to it, when I received the favour from him, to
have the most considerable event of it modelled by
his royal pleasure. It may be some vanity in me
to add his testimony then, and which he graciously
confirmed afterwards, that it was the best of all my
<a class="pgnm" id="page_185" name="page_185"></a>
tragedies; in which he has made authentic my private
opinion of it; at least, he has given it a value
by his commendation, which it had not by my writing.</p>

<p>That which was not pleasing to some of the fair
ladies in the last act of it, as I dare not vindicate,
so neither can I wholly condemn, till I find more
reason for their censures. The procedure of Indamora
and Melesinda seems yet, in my judgment,
natural, and not unbecoming of their characters.
If they, who arraign them, fail not more, the world
will never blame their conduct; and I shall be
glad, for the honour of my country, to find better
images of virtue drawn to the life in their behaviour,
than any I could feign to adorn the theatre. I
confess, I have only represented a practical virtue,
mixed with the frailties and imperfections of human
life. I have made my heroine fearful of death,
which neither Cassandra nor Cleopatra would have
been; and they themselves, I doubt it not, would
have outdone romance in that particular. Yet their
Mandana (and the Cyrus was written by a lady,)
was not altogether so hard-hearted: For she sat
down on the cold ground by the king of Assyria,
and not only pitied him, who died in her defence;
but allowed him some favours, such, perhaps, as
they would think, should only be permitted to her
Cyrus<a class="ftnt" href="#Auren_2-7">[7]</a>. I have made my Melesinda, in opposition
to Nourmahal, a woman passionately loving of her
husband, patient of injuries and contempt, and constant
in her kindness, to the last; and in that, perhaps,
I may have erred, because it is not a virtue
much in use. Those Indian wives are loving fools,
and may do well to keep themselves in their own
<a class="pgnm" id="page_186" name="page_186"></a>
country, or, at least, to keep company with the Arrias
and Portias of old Rome: Some of our ladies
know better things. But, it may be, I am partial
to my own writings; yet I have laboured as much
as any man, to divest myself of the self-opinion of
an author; and am too well satisfied of my own
weakness, to be pleased with any thing I have written.
But, on the other side, my reason tells me, that,
in probability, what I have seriously and long considered
may be as likely to be just and natural, as
what an ordinary judge (if there be any such among
those ladies) will think fit, in a transient presentation,
to be placed in the room of that which they
condemn. The most judicious writer is sometimes
mistaken, after all his care; but the hasty critic,
who judges on a view, is full as liable to be deceived.
Let him first consider all the arguments,
which the author had, to write this, or to design
the other, before he arraigns him of a fault; and
then, perhaps, on second thoughts, he will find his
reason oblige him to revoke his censure. Yet,
after all, I will not be too positive. <i>Homo sum, humani
&agrave; me nihil alienum puto.</i> As I am a man, I
must be changeable; and sometimes the gravest of
us all are so, even upon ridiculous accidents. Our
minds are perpetually wrought on by the temperament
of our bodies; which makes me suspect, they
are nearer allied, than either our philosophers or
school-divines will allow them to be. I have observed,
says Montaigne, that when the body is out
of order, its companion is seldom at his ease. An
ill dream, or a cloudy day, has power to change this
wretched creature, who is so proud of a reasonable
soul, and make him think what he thought not yesterday.
And Homer was of this opinion, as Cicero
is pleased to translate him for us:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Tales sunt hominum mentes, quali pater ipse</p>
<p>Jupiter auctifer&acirc; lustravit lampade terras.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><a class="pgnm" id="page_187" name="page_187"></a>
Or, as the same author, in his "Tusculan Questions,"
speaks, with more modesty than usual, of himself:
<i>Nos in diem vivimus; quodcunque animos nostros probabilitate
percussit, id dicimus.</i> It is not therefore impossible
but that I may alter the conclusion of my
play, to restore myself into the good graces of my
fair critics; and your lordship, who is so well with
them, may do me the office of a friend and patron,
to intercede with them on my promise of amendment.
The impotent lover in Petronius, though his
was a very unpardonable crime, yet was received to
mercy on the terms I offer. <i>Summa excusationis
me&aelig; h&aelig;c est: Placebo tibi, si culpam emendare permiseris.</i></p>

<p>But I am conscious to myself of offering at a
greater boldness, in presenting to your view what
my meanness can produce, than in any other error of
my play; and therefore make haste to break off this
tedious address, which has, I know not how, already
run itself into so much of pedantry, with an excuse of
Tully's, which he sent with his books "De Finibus,"
to his friend Brutus: <i>De ipsis rebus autem, s&aelig;penumer&ograve;,
Brute, vereor ne reprehendar, cum h&aelig;c ad te
scribam, qui tum in poesi,</i> (I change it from <i>philosophi&acirc;</i>)
<i>tum in optimo genere poeseos tantum processeris.
Quod si facerem quasi te erudiens, jure reprehenderer.
Sed ab eo plurim&ugrave;m absum: Nec, ut ea cognoscas qu&aelig;
tibi notissima sunt, ad te mitto; sed qui&agrave; facillim&egrave; in
nomine tuo acquiesco, et quia te habeo &aelig;quissimum eorum
studiorum, qu&aelig; mihi communia tecum sunt, &aelig;stimatorem
et judicem.</i> Which you may please, my
lord, to apply to yourself, from him, who is,</p>

<p class="sig i1">Your Lordship's</p>
<p class="sig i2">Most obedient,</p>
<p class="sig i3">Humble servant,</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a id="Auren_2-1" name="Auren_2-1"></a>John Sheffield, earl of Mulgrave, afterwards created marquis
of Normanby, and at length duke of Buckingham, made a great
figure during the reigns of Charles II. of his unfortunate successor,
of William the Third, and of Queen Anne. His bravery as a soldier,
and abilities as a statesman, seem to have been unquestioned;
but for his poetical reputation, he was probably much indebted
to the assistance of those wits whom he relieved and patronized.
As, however, it has been allowed a sufficient proof of wisdom in a
monarch, that he could chuse able ministers, so it is no slight commendation
to the taste of this rhyming peer, that in youth he selected
Dryden to supply his own poetical deficiencies, and in age
became the friend and the eulogist of Pope. We may observe,
however, a melancholy difference betwixt the manner in which an
independent man of letters is treated by the great, and that in
which they think themselves entitled to use one to whom their
countenance is of consequence. In addressing Pope, Sheffield contents
himself with launching out into boundless panegyric, while
his praise of Dryden, in his "Essay on Poetry," is qualified by a
gentle sneer at the "Hind and Panther," our bard's most laboured
production. His lordship is treating of satire:<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>The laureat here may justly claim our praise,</p>
<p>Crowned by Mack Flecnoe with immortal bays;</p>
<p>Yet once his Pegasus has borne dead weight,</p>
<p>Rid by some lumpish minister of state.</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Mulgrave, to distinguish him by his earliest title, certainly
received considerable assistance from Dryden in "The Essay on
Satire," which occasioned Rochester's base revenge; and was distinguished
by the name of the <i>Rose-Alley Satire</i>, from the place
in which Dryden was way-laid and beaten by the hired bravoes of
that worthless profligate. It is probable, that the patronage which
Dryden received from Mulgrave, was not entirely of an empty and
fruitless nature. It is at least certain, that their friendship continued
uninterrupted till the death of our poet. The "Discourse
upon Epic Poetry" is dedicated to Lord Mulgrave, then duke of
Buckingham, and in high favour with Queen Anne, for whom he
is supposed to have long cherished a youthful passion. After the
grave of Dryden had remained twenty years without a memorial,
this nobleman had the honour to raise the present monument at
his own expence; being the latest, and certainly one of the most
honourable acts of his life.</p>

<p>Mr Malone, from Macky's "Secret Services," gives the following
character of Sheffield, duke of Buckingham:&mdash;"He is a nobleman
of learning and good natural parts, but of no principles.
Violent for the high church, yet seldom goes to it. Very proud,
insolent, and covetous, and takes all advantages. In paying his
debts unwilling, and is neither esteemed nor beloved; for notwithstanding
his great interest at court, it is certain he has none in either
house of parliament, or in the country. He is of a middle
stature, of a brown complexion, with a sour lofty look." Swift
sanctioned this severe character, by writing on the margin of his
copy of Macky's book, "<i>This character is the truest of any.</i>" To
so bitter a censure, let us contrast the panegyric of Pope:<br /><br /></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Muse, 'tis enough; at length thy labour ends,</p>
<p>And thou shalt live, for Buckingham commends;</p>
<p>Let crowds of critics now my verse assail,</p>
<p>Let Dennis write, and nameless numbers rail,</p>
<p>This more than pays whole years of thankless pain&mdash;</p>
<p>Time, health, and fortune, are not lost in vain.</p>
<p>Sheffield approves; consenting Ph&oelig;bus bends,</p>
<p>And I and Malice from this hour are friends.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be worth the attention of the great to consider the value
of that genius, which can hand them down to posterity in an interesting
and amiable point of view, in spite of their own imbecilities,
errors, and vices. While the personal character of Mulgrave
has nothing to recommend it, and his poetical effusions are
sunk into oblivion, we still venerate the friend of Pope, and the
protector of Dryden.</p>

<p>Sheffield, duke of Buckingham, marquis of Normanby, and earl
of Mulgrave, was born in 1649, and died in 1720. He was therefore
twenty-seven years old when he received this dedication.</p></li>

<li><a id="Auren_2-3" name="Auren_2-3"></a>The earl of Mulgrave, in the Dutch war of 1672, served as
a volunteer on board the Victory, commanded by the earl of Ossory.
He behaved with distinguished courage himself, and has
borne witness to that of his unfortunate admiral, James Duke of
York. His intrepid coolness appears from a passage in his Memoirs,
containing the observations he made during the action,
on the motion of cannon bullets in the recoil, and their effect
when passing near the human body. His bravery was rewarded
by his promotion to command the Katharine, the second best ship
in the fleet. This vessel had been captured by the Dutch during
the action, but was retaken by the English crew before she could
be carried into harbour. Lord Mulgrave had a picture of the
Katherine at his house in St James's Park.&mdash;See CARLETON'S

<li><a id="Auren_2-4" name="Auren_2-4"></a>In 1548-9, there were insurrections in several counties of England,
having for their object the restoration of the Catholic religion,
and the redress of grievances. The insurgents in Northamptonshire
were 20,000 strong, headed by one Ket, a tanner, who possessed
himself of Norwich. The earl of Northampton, marching
rashly and hastily against him, at the head of a very inferior force,
was defeated with loss. In the rout lord Sheffield, ancestor of the
earl of Mulgrave, and the person alluded to in the text, fell with his
horse into a ditch, and was slain by a butcher with a club. The
rebels were afterwards defeated by the earl of Warwick.&mdash;DUGDALE'S

<h3 class="chap">PROLOGUE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>Our author, by experience, finds it true,</p>
<p>'Tis much more hard to please himself than you;</p>
<p>And out of no feigned modesty, this day</p>
<p>Damns his laborious trifle of a play:</p>
<p>Not that its worse than what before he writ,</p>
<p>But he has now another taste of wit;</p>
<p>And, to confess a truth, though out of time,</p>
<p>Grows weary of his long-loved mistress, Rhyme.</p>
<p>Passion's too fierce to be in fetters bound,</p>
<p>And nature flies him like enchanted ground:</p>
<p>What verse can do, he has performed in this,</p>
<p>Which he presumes the most correct of his;</p>
<p>But spite of all his pride, a secret shame</p>
<p>Invades his breast at Shakespeare's sacred name:</p>
<p>Awed when he hears his godlike Romans rage,</p>
<p>He, in a just despair, would quit the stage;</p>
<p>And to an age less polished, more unskilled,</p>
<p>Does, with disdain, the foremost honours yield.</p>
<p>As with the greater dead he dares not strive,</p>
<p>He would not match his verse with those who live:</p>
<p>Let him retire, betwixt two ages cast,</p>
<p>The first of this, and hindmost of the last.</p>
<p>A losing gamester, let him sneak away;</p>
<p>He bears no ready money from the play.</p>
<p>The fate, which governs poets, thought it fit</p>
<p>He should not raise his fortunes by his wit.</p>
<p>The clergy thrive, and the litigious bar;</p>
<p>Dull heroes fatten with the spoils of war:</p>
<p>All southern vices, heaven be praised, are here:</p>
<p>But wit's a luxury you think too dear.</p>
<p>When you to cultivate the plant are loth,</p>
<p>'Tis a shrewd sign 'twas never of your growth;</p>
<p>And wit in northern climates will not blow,</p>
<p>Except, like orange-trees, 'tis housed from snow.</p>
<p>There needs no care to put a playhouse down,</p>
<p>'Tis the most desart place of all the town:</p>
<p>We and our neighbours, to speak proudly, are,</p>
<p>Like monarchs, ruined with expensive war;</p>
<p>While, like wise English, unconcerned you sit,</p>
<p>And see us play the tragedy of wit.</p>

<h4 class="scn">ACT I. SCENE I.</h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Arimant, Asaph Chan,</span> and <span class="cnm">Fazel Chan.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> Heaven seems the empire of the east to lay<br />
On the success of this important day:<br />
Their arms are to the last decision bent,<br />
And fortune labours with the vast event:<br />
She now has in her hand the greatest stake,<br />
Which for contending monarchs she can make.<br />
Whate'er can urge ambitious youth to fight,<br />
She pompously displays before their sight;<br />
Laws, empire, all permitted to the sword,<br />
And fate could ne'er an ampler scene afford.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asaph.</span> Four several armies to the field are led,<br />
Which, high in equal hopes, four princes head:<br />
Indus and Ganges, our wide empire's bounds,<br />
Swell their dyed currents with their natives' wounds:<br />
Each purple river winding, as he runs,<br />
His bloody arms about his slaughtered sons.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fazel.</span> I well remember you foretold the storm,<br />
When first the brothers did their factions form:<br />
When each, by cursed cabals of women, strove<br />
To draw the indulgent king to partial love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_192" name="page_192"></a>
<span class="cnm">Arim.</span> What heaven decrees, no prudence can prevent.<br />
To cure their mad ambition, they were sent<br />
To rule a distant province each alone:<br />
What could a careful father more have done?<br />
He made provision against all, but fate,<br />
While, by his health, we held our peace of state.<br />
The weight of seventy winters prest him down,<br />
He bent beneath the burden of a crown:<br />
Sickness, at last, did his spent body seize,<br />
And life almost sunk under the disease:<br />
Mortal 'twas thought, at least by them desired,<br />
Who, impiously, into his years inquired:<br />
As at a signal, strait the sons prepare<br />
For open force, and rush to sudden war:<br />
Meeting, like winds broke loose upon the main,<br />
To prove, by arms, whose fate it was to reign.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asaph.</span> Rebels and parricides!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> Brand not their actions with so foul a name:<br />
Pity at least what we are forced to blame.<br />
When death's cold hand has closed the father's eye,<br />
You know the younger sons are doomed to die.<br />
Less ills are chosen greater to avoid,<br />
And nature's laws are by the state's destroyed.<br />
What courage tamely could to death consent,<br />
And not, by striking first, the blow prevent?<br />
Who falls in fight, cannot himself accuse,<br />
And he dies greatly, who a crown pursues.</p>

<p class="sdn">To them <span class="cnm">Solyman Aga.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Solym.</span> A new express all Agra does affright:<br />
Darah and Aureng-Zebe are joined in fight;<br />
The press of people thickens to the court,<br />
The impatient crowd devouring the report.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> T' each changing news they changed affections bring,<br />
And servilely from fate expect a king.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_193" name="page_193"></a>
<span class="cnm">Solym.</span> The ministers of state, who gave us law,<br />
In corners, with selected friends, withdraw:<br />
There, in deaf murmurs, solemnly are wise;<br />
Whispering, like winds, ere hurricanes arise.<br />
The most corrupt are most obsequious grown,<br />
And those they scorned, officiously they own.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asaph.</span> In change of government,<br />
The rabble rule their great oppressors' fate;<br />
Do sovereign justice, and revenge the state.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Solym.</span> The little courtiers, who ne'er come to know<br />
The depth of factions, as in mazes go,<br />
Where interests meet and cross so oft, that they,<br />
With too much care, are wildered in their way.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> What of the emperor?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Solym.</span> Unmoved, and brave, he like himself appears,<br />
And, meriting no ill, no danger fears:<br />
Yet mourns his former vigour lost so far,<br />
To make him now spectator of a war:<br />
Repining that he must preserve his crown<br />
By any help or courage but his own:<br />
Wishes, each minute, he could unbeget<br />
Those rebel sons, who dare usurp his seat;<br />
To sway his empire with unequal skill,<br />
And mount a throne, which none but he can fill.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> Oh! had he still that character maintained,<br />
Of valour, which, in blooming youth, he gained!<br />
He promised in his east a glorious race;<br />
Now, sunk from his meridian, sets apace.<br />
But as the sun, when he from noon declines,<br />
And, with abated heat, less fiercely shines,<br />
Seems to grow milder as he goes away,<br />
Pleasing himself with the remains of day;<br />
So he, who, in his youth, for glory strove,<br />
Would recompense his age with ease and love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_194" name="page_194"></a>
<span class="cnm">Asaph.</span> The name of father hateful to him grows,<br />
Which, for one son, produces him three foes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Fazel.</span> Darah, the eldest, bears a generous mind,<br />
But to implacable revenge inclined:<br />
Too openly does love and hatred show;<br />
A bounteous master, but a deadly foe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Solym.</span> From Sujah's valour I should much expect,<br />
But he's a bigot of the Persian sect;<br />
And by a foreign interest seeks to reign,<br />
Hopeless by love the sceptre to obtain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asaph.</span> Morat's too insolent, too much a brave;<br />
His courage to his envy is a slave.<br />
What he attempts, if his endeavours fail<br />
To effect, he is resolved no other shall.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> But Aureng-Zebe, by no strong passion swayed,<br />
Except his love, more temperate is, and weighed:<br />
This Atlas must our sinking state uphold;<br />
In council cool, but in performance bold:<br />
He sums their virtues in himself alone,<br />
And adds the greatest, of a loyal son:<br />
His father's cause upon his sword he wears,<br />
And with his arms, we hope, his fortune bears.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Solym.</span> Two vast rewards may well his courage move,<br />
A parent's blessing, and a mistress' love.<br />
If he succeed, his recompence, we hear,<br />
Must be the captive queen of Cassimere.</p>

<p class="sdn">To them <span class="cnm">Abas.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Abas.</span> Mischiefs on mischiefs, greater still, and more!<br />
The neighbouring plain with arms is covered o'er:<br />
The vale an iron-harvest seems to yield,<br />
Of thick-sprung lances in a waving field.<br />
The polished steel gleams terribly from far,<br />
And every moment nearer shows the war.<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_195" name="page_195"></a>
The horses' neighing by the wind is blown,<br />
And castled-elephants o'er-look the town.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> If, as I fear, Morat these powers commands,<br />
Our empire on the brink of ruin stands:<br />
The ambitious empress with her son is joined,<br />
And, in his brother's absence, has designed<br />
The unprovided town to take with ease,<br />
And then the person of the king to seize.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Solym.</span> To all his former issue she has shown<br />
Long hate, and laboured to advance her own.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Abas.</span> These troops are his.<br />
Surat he took; and thence, preventing fame,<br />
By quick and painful marches hither came.<br />
Since his approach, he to his mother sent,<br />
And two long hours in close debate were spent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> I'll to my charge, the citadel, repair,<br />
And show my duty by my timely care.</p>

<p class="sdn">To them the Emperor, with a letter in his hand: After
him, an Ambassador, with a train following.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Asaph.</span> But see, the emperor! a fiery red<br />
His brows and glowing temples does o'erspread;<br />
Morat has some displeasing message sent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amb.</span> Do not, great sir, misconstrue his intent;<br />
Nor call rebellion what was prudent care,<br />
To guard himself by necessary war:<br />
While he believed you living, he obeyed;<br />
His governments but as your viceroy swayed:<br />
But, when he thought you gone<br />
To augment the number of the blessed above,<br />
He deemed them legacies of royal love:<br />
Nor armed, his brothers' portions to invade,<br />
But to defend the present you had made.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> By frequent messages, and strict commands,<br />
He knew my pleasure to discharge his bands:<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_196" name="page_196"></a>
Proof of my life my royal signet made;<br />
Yet still he armed, came on, and disobeyed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amb.</span> He thought the mandate forged, your death concealed;<br />
And but delayed, till truth should be revealed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> News of my death from rumour he received;<br />
And what he wished, he easily believed:<br />
But long demurred, though from my hand he knew<br />
I lived, so loth he was to think it true.<br />
Since he pleads ignorance to that command,<br />
Now let him show his duty, and disband.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amb.</span> His honour, sir, will suffer in the cause;<br />
He yields his arms unjust, if he withdraws:<br />
And begs his loyalty may be declared,<br />
By owning those he leads to be your guard.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> I, in myself, have all the guard I need!<br />
Bid the presumptuous boy draw off with speed:<br />
If his audacious troops one hour remain,<br />
My cannon from the fort shall scour the plain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Amb.</span> Since you deny him entrance, he demands<br />
His wife, whom cruelly you hold in bands:<br />
Her, if unjustly you from him detain,<br />
He justly will, by force of arms, regain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> O'er him and his a right from Heaven I have;<br />
Subject and son, he's doubly born my slave.<br />
But whatsoe'er his own demerits are,<br />
Tell him, I shall not make on women war.<br />
And yet I'll do her innocence the grace,<br />
To keep her here, as in the safer place.<br />
But thou, who dar'st this bold defiance bring,<br />
May'st feel the rage of an offended king.<br />
Hence, from my sight, without the least reply!<br />
One word, nay one look more, and thou shalt die.

Re-enter <span class="cnm">Arimant.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> May heaven, great monarch, still augment your bliss<br />
With length of days, and every day like this!<br />
For, from the banks of Gemna news is brought,<br />
Your army has a bloody battle fought:<br />
Darah from loyal Aureng-Zebe is fled,<br />
And forty thousand of his men lie dead.<br />
To Sujah next your conquering army drew;<br />
Him they surprised, and easily o'erthrew.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> 'Tis well.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> But well! what more could at your wish be done,<br />
Than two such conquests gained by such a son?<br />
Your pardon, mighty sir;<br />
You seem not high enough your joys to rate;<br />
You stand indebted a vast sum to fate,<br />
And should large thanks for the great blessing pay.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> My fortune owes me greater every day;<br />
And should my joy more high for this appear,<br />
It would have argued me, before, of fear.<br />
How is heaven kind, where I have nothing won,<br />
And fortune only pays me with my own?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> Great Aureng-Zebe did duteous care express,<br />
And durst not push too far his good success;<br />
But, lest Morat the city should attack,<br />
Commanded his victorious army back;<br />
Which, left to march as swiftly as they may,<br />
Himself comes first, and will be here this day,<br />
Before a close-formed siege shut up his way.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> Prevent his purpose! hence, with all thy speed!<br />
Stop him; his entrance to the town forbid.</p>

<span class="cnm">Arim.</span> Whom with your power and fortune, sir, you trust.<br />
Now to suspect is vain, as 'tis unjust.<br />
He comes not with a train to move your fear,<br />
But trusts himself to be a prisoner here.<br />
You knew him brave, you know him faithful now:<br />
He aims at fame, but fame from serving you.<br />
'Tis said, ambition in his breast does rage:<br />
Who would not be the hero of an age?<br />
All grant him prudent: Prudence interest weighs,<br />
And interest bids him seek your love and praise.<br />
I know you grateful; when he marched from hence,<br />
You bade him hope an ample recompence:<br />
He conquered in that hope; and, from your hands,<br />
His love, the precious pledge he left, demands.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> No more; you search too deep my wounded mind,<br />
And show me what I fear, and would not find.<br />
My son has all the debts of duty paid:<br />
Our prophet sends him to my present aid.<br />
Such virtue to distrust were base and low:<br />
I'm not ungrateful&mdash;or I was not so!<br />

Torn out the bearded steel, to give me rest;<br />
At least, thou should'st have guessed&mdash;<br />
Yet thou art honest, thou couldst ne'er have guessed.<br />
Hast thou been never base? did love ne'er bend<br />
Thy frailer virtue, to betray thy friend?<br />
Flatter me, make thy court, and say, It did;<br />
Kings in a crowd would have their vices hid.<br />
We would be kept in count'nance, saved from shame,<br />
And owned by others who commit the same.<br />
Nay, now I have confessed.<br />
Thou seest me naked, and without disguise:<br />
I look on Aureng-Zebe with rival's eyes.<br />
He has abroad my enemies o'ercome,<br />
And I have sought to ruin him at home.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Arim.</span> This free confession shows you long did strive;<br />

But what success did your injustice find?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Emp.</span> What it deserved, and not what I designed.<br />
Unmoved she stood, and deaf to all my prayers,<br />
As seas and winds to sinking mariners.<br />
But seas grow calm, and winds are reconciled:<br />

Prayers, promises, and threats, were all in vain.</p>

Too haughty to endure neglected charms.<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Unknown to me,<br />
He took my arms; and, while I forced my way<br />
Through troops of foes, which did our passage stay,<br />
My buckler o'er my aged father cast,<br />
Still fighting, still defending as I past,<br />
The noble Arimant usurped my name;<br />
Fought, and took from me, while he gave me, fame.<br />
To Aureng-Zebe, he made his soldiers cry,<br />
And, seeing not, where he heard danger nigh,<br />
Shot, like a star, through the benighted sky,<br />
A short, but mighty aid: At length he fell.<br />
My own adventures 'twere lost time to tell;<br />
Or how my army, entering in the night,<br />
Surprised our foes; The dark disordered fight:<br />
How my appearance, and my father shown,<br />
Made peace; and all the rightful monarch own.<br />

I heard his words, and did your actions view;<br />
You seemed to mourn another lover dead:<br />
My sighs you gave him, and my tears you shed.<br />

Your gratitude for his defence was shown:<br />
It proved you valued life, when I was gone.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ind.</span> Not that I valued life, but feared to die:<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aur.</span> Fear showed you doubted of your own intent:<br />
And she, who doubts, becomes less innocent.<br />
Tell me not you could fear;<br />
Fear's a large promiser; who subject live<br />

No circumstance of grief you did deny;<br />

TRAGEDY.</h3>

<div><a class="pgnm" id="page_287" name="page_287"></a></div>

<h3 class="chap">ALL FOR LOVE.</h3>

<p>The prologue to the preceding play has already acquainted us,
that Dryden's taste for Rhyming, or Heroic Plays, was then upon
the wane; and, accordingly "Aureng-Zebe" was the last tragedy
which he formed upon that once admired model. "Henceforth
a series of new times began," for, when given up by the only writer,
whose command of flowing and powerful numbers had rendered it
impressive, that department of the drama was soon abandoned by
the inferior class of play-writers, to whom it presented multiplied
difficulties, without a single advantage. The new taste, which our
author had now decidedly adopted, was founded upon the stile of
Shakespeare, of whose works he appears always to have been a persevering
student, and, at length, an ardent admirer. Accordingly,
he informs us, in the introduction, that this play is professedly
written in imitation of "the divine Shakespeare." As if to bring
this more immediately under the eye of the reader, he has chosen a
subject upon which his immortal original had already laboured;
and, perhaps, the most proper introduction to "All for Love"
may be a parallel betwixt it and Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra."</p>

<p>The first point of comparison is the general conduct, or plot, of
the tragedy. And here Dryden, having, to use his own language,
undertaken to shoot in the bow of Ulysses, imitates the wily Antinous
in using art to eke out his strength, and suppling the weapon
before he attempted to bend it.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, with the license peculiar to his age and character,
had diffused the action of his play over Italy, Greece, and
Egypt; but Dryden, who was well aware of the advantage to be
derived from a simplicity and concentration of plot, has laid every
scene in the city of Alexandria. By this he guarded the audience
from that vague and puzzling distraction which must necessarily attend
a violent change of place. It is a mistake to suppose, that the
argument in favour of the unities depends upon preserving the deception
of the scene; they are necessarily connected with the intelligibility
of the piece. It may be true, that no spectator supposes
that the stage before him is actually the court of Alexandria;
yet, when he has once made up his mind to let it pass as such during
the representation, it is a cruel tax, not merely on his imagination,
but on his powers of comprehension, if the scene be suddenly
<a class="pgnm" id="page_288" name="page_288"></a>
transferred to a distant country. Time is lost before he can form
new associations, and reconcile their bearings with those originally
presented to him, and if he be a person of slow comprehension,
or happens to lose any part of the dialogue, announcing the changes,
the whole becomes unintelligible confusion. In this respect,
and in discarding a number of uninteresting characters, the plan
of Dryden's play must be unequivocally preferred to that of Shakespeare
in point of coherence, unity, and simplicity. It is a natural
consequence of this more artful arrangement of the story, that
Dryden contents himself with the concluding scene of Antony's history
instead of introducing the incidents of the war with Cneius
Pompey, the negociation with Lepidus, death of his first wife, and
other circumstances, which, in Shakespeare, only tend to distract
our attention from the main interest of the drama. The union of
time, as necessary as that of place to the intelligibility of the
drama, has, in like manner, been happily attained; and an interesting
event is placed before the audience with no other change of
place, and no greater lapse of time, than can be readily adapted to
an ordinary imagination.</p>

<p>But, having given Dryden the praise of superior address in managing
the story, I fear he must be pronounced in most other respects
inferior to his grand prototype. Antony, the principal character
in both plays, is incomparably grander in that of Shakespeare.
The majesty and generosity of the military hero is happily expressed
by both poets; but the awful ruin of grandeur, undermined
by passion, and tottering to its fall, is far more striking in the
Antony of Shakespeare. Love, it is true, is the predominant;
but it is not the sole ingredient in his character. It has usurped
possession of his mind, but is assailed by his original passions, ambition
of power, and thirst for military fame. He is, therefore,
often, and it should seem naturally represented, as feeling for the
downfall of his glory and power, even so intensely as to withdraw
his thoughts from Cleopatra, unless considered as the cause of his
ruin. Thus, in the scene in which he compares himself to "black
Vesper's pageants," he runs on in a train of fantastic and melancholy
similes, having relation only to his fallen state, till the mention
of Egypt suddenly recalls the idea of Cleopatra. But Dryden has
taken a different view of Antony's character, and more closely approaching
to his title of "All for Love."&mdash;"He seems not now
that awful Antony." His whole thoughts and being are dedicated
to his fatal passion; and though a spark of resentment is occasionally
struck out by the reproaches of Ventidius, he instantly
relapses into love-sick melancholy. The following beautiful
speech exhibits the romance of despairing love, without the deep
<a class="pgnm" id="page_289" name="page_289"></a>
and mingled passion of a dishonoured soldier, and dethroned emperor:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> [<span class="sdm">Throwing himself down.</span>]<br />
Lie there, thou shadow of an emperor;<br />
The place, thou pressest on thy mother earth,<br />
Is all thy empire now: Now, it contains thee;<br />
Some few days hence, and then 'twill be too large,<br />
When thou'rt contracted in the narrow urn,<br />
Shrunk to a few cold ashes; then, Octavia,<br />
For Cleopatra will not live to see it,<br />
Octavia then will have thee all her own,<br />
And bear thee in her widowed hand to C&aelig;sar;<br />
C&aelig;sar will weep, the crocodile will weep,<br />
To see his rival of the universe<br />
Lie still and peaceful there. I'll think no more on't.<br />
Give me some music; look that it be sad:<br />
I'll sooth my melancholy, 'till I swell,<br />
And burst myself with sighing&mdash;<span class="sdr">[Soft music.</span><br />
'Tis somewhat to my humour: Stay, I fancy<br />
I'm now turned wild, a commoner of nature;<br />
Of all forsaken, and forsaking all;<br />
Live in a shady forest's sylvan scene,<br />
Stretched at my length beneath some blasted oak,<br />
I lean my head upon the mossy bark,<br />
And look just of a piece, as I grew from it:<br />
My uncombed locks, matted like misletoe,<br />
Hang o'er my hoary face; a murmuring brook<br />
Runs at my foot.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ven.</span> Methinks I fancy<br />
Myself there too.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> The herd come jumping by me,<br />
And, fearless, quench their thirst, while I look on,<br />
And take me for their fellow-citizen.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even when Antony is finally ruined, the power of jealousy is
called upon to complete his despair, and he is less sensible to the
idea of C&aelig;sar's successful arms, than to the risque of Dolabella's
rivalling him in the affections of Cleopatra. It is true, the
Antony of Shakespeare also starts into fury, upon Cleopatra permitting
Thyreus to kiss her hand; but this is not jealousy; it is
pride offended, that she, for whom he had sacrificed his glory and
empire, should already begin to court the favour of the conqueror,
and vouchsafe her hand to be saluted by a "jack of C&aelig;sars."
Hence Enobarbus, the witness of the scene, alludes immediately to
the fury of mortified ambition and falling power:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp,</p>
<p>Than with an old one dying&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Having, however, adopted an idea of Antony's character, rather
suitable to romance than to nature, or history, we must not deny
<a class="pgnm" id="page_290" name="page_290"></a>
Dryden the praise of having exquisitely brought out the picture he
intended to draw. He has informed us, that this was the only
play written to please himself; and he has certainly exerted in it
the full force of his incomparable genius. Antony is throughout
the piece what the author meant him to be; a victim to the omnipotence
of love, or rather to the infatuation of one engrossing
passion<a class="ftnt" href="#All_1-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Cleopatra of Dryden, there is greatly less spirit and originality
than in Shakespeare's. The preparation of the latter for
death has a grandeur which puts to shame the same scene in Dryden,
and serves to support the interest during the whole fifth act,
although Antony has died in the conclusion of the fourth. No
circumstance can more highly evince the power of Shakespeare's
genius, in spite of his irregularities; since the conclusion in Dryden,
where both lovers die in the same scene, and after a reconciliation,
is infinitely more artful and better adapted to theatrical
effect.</p>

<p>In the character of Ventidius, Dryden has filled up, with ability,
the rude sketches, which Shakespeare has thrown off in those
of Sc&aelig;va and Eros. The rough old Roman soldier is painted with
great truth; and the quarrel betwixt him and Antony, in the
first act, is equal to any single scene that our author ever wrote,
excepting, perhaps, that betwixt Sebastian and Dorax; an opinion
in which the judgment of the critic coincides with that of the
poet. It is a pity, as has often been remarked, that this dialogue
occurs so early in the play, since what follows is necessarily inferior
in force. Dryden, while writing this scene, had unquestionably
in his recollection the quarrel betwixt Brutus and Cassius,
which was justly so great a favourite in his time, and to which he
had referred as inimitable in his prologue to "Aureng-Zebe.<a class="ftnt" href="#All_1-2">[2]</a>"</p>

<p>The inferior characters are better supported in Dryden than in
<a class="pgnm" id="page_291" name="page_291"></a>
Shakespeare. We have no low buffoonery in the former, such as
disgraces Enobarbus, and is hardly redeemed by his affecting catastrophe.
Even the Egyptian Alexas acquires some respectability,
from his patriotic attachment to the interests of his country,
and from his skill as a wily courtier. He expresses, by a beautiful
image, the effeminate attachment to life, appropriated to his character and country:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>O, that I less could fear to lose this being,</p>
<p>Which, like a snow-ball in my coward hand,</p>
<p>The more 'tis grasped, the faster melts away.</p>
</div>

<p>The Octavia of Dryden is a much more important personage
than in the "Antony and Cleopatra" of Shakespeare. She is, however,
more cold and unamiable; for, in the very short scenes in
which the Octavia of Shakespeare appears, she is placed in rather
an interesting point of view. But Dryden has himself informed
us, that he was apprehensive the justice of a wife's claim upon her
husband would draw the audience to her side, and lessen their interest
in the lover and the mistress. He seems accordingly to
have studiedly lowered the character of the injured Octavia, who,
in her conduct towards her husband, shews much duty and little
love; and plainly intimates, that her rectitude of conduct flows
from a due regard to her own reputation, rather than from attachment
to Antony's person, or sympathy with him in his misfortunes.
It happens, therefore, with Octavia, as with all other very
good selfish kind of people; we think it unnecessary to feel any
thing for her, as she is obviously capable of taking very good care
of herself. I must not omit, that her scolding scene with Cleopatra,
although anxiously justified by the author in the preface,
seems too coarse to be in character, and is a glaring exception to
the general good taste evinced throughout the rest of the piece.</p>

<p>It would be too long a task to contrast the beauties of these
two great poets in point of diction and style. But the reader will
doubtless be pleased to compare the noted descriptions of the voyage
of Cleopatra down the Cydnus. It is thus given in Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,</p>
<p>Burned on the water: The poop was beaten gold;</p>
<p>Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that</p>
<p>The winds were love-sick with them: The oars were silver;</p>
<p>Which, to the tune of flutes, kept stroke, and made</p>
<p>The water which they beat, to follow faster,</p>
<p>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</p>
<p>It beggared all description: she did lie</p>
<p>In her pavilion (cloth of gold, of tissue),</p>
<p><a class="pgnm" id="page_292" name="page_292"></a>
O'er-picturing that Venus, where we see,</p>
<p>The fancy outwork nature; on each side her,</p>
<p>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</p>
<p>With diverse coloured fans, whose wind did seem</p>
<p>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</p>
<p>And what they undid, did.</p>
<p>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereids,</p>
<p>So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,</p>
<p>And made their bends adornings: At the helm</p>
<p>A seeming mermaid steers: The silken tackle</p>
<p>Swells with the touches of those flower-soft hands</p>
<p>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</p>
<p>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</p>
<p>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</p>
<p>Her people out upon her; and Antony,</p>
<p>Enthroned in the market-place, did sit alone,</p>
<p>Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,</p>
<p>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</p>
<p>And made a gap in nature.</p>
<p class="citation"><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act i. Scene 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The parallel passage in Dryden runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="dlg">The tackling silk, the streamers waved with gold,<br />
The gentle winds were lodged in purple sails:<br />
Her nymphs, like Nereids, round her couch were placed;<br />
Where she, another sea-born Venus, lay,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> No more: I would not hear it,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> O, you must!<br />
She lay, and leant her cheek upon her hand,<br />
And cast a look so languishingly sweet,<br />
As if secure of all beholders hearts,<br />
Neglecting she could take them: Boys, like Cupids,<br />
Stood fanning, with their painted wings, the winds<br />
That played about her face! But if she smiled,<br />
A darting glory secured to blaze abroad:<br />
That men's desiring eyes were never wearied,<br />
But hung upon the object: To soft flutes<br />
The silver oars kept time; and while they played,<br />
The hearing gave new pleasure to the sight;<br />
And both to thought. 'Twas heaven, or somewhat more;<br />
For she so charmed all hearts, that gazing crowds<br />
Stood panting on the shore, and wanted breath<br />
To give their welcome voice.<br />
Then, Dolabella, where was then thy soul?<br />
Was not thy fury quite disarmed with murder?<br />
Didst thou not shrink behind me from those eyes,<br />
And whisper in my ear, Oh, tell her not<br />
That I accused her of my brother's death?</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In judging betwixt these celebrated passages, we feel almost
afraid to avow a preference of Dryden, founded partly upon the
easy flow of the verse, which seems to soften with the subject,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_293" name="page_293"></a>
but chiefly upon the beauty of the language and imagery, which
is flowery without diffusiveness, and rapturous without hyperbole.
I fear Shakespeare cannot be exculpated from the latter fault;
yet I am sensible, it is by sifting his beauties from his conceits
that his imitator has been enabled to excel him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to bestow too much praise on the beautiful passages
which occur so frequently in "All for Love." Having already
given several examples of happy expression of melancholy
and tender feelings, I content myself with extracting the sublime
and terrific description of an omen presaging the downfall of
Egypt.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> Last night, between the hours of twelve and one,<br />
In a lone isle of the temple while I walked,<br />
A whirlwind rose, that, with a violent blast,<br />
Shook all the dome: The doors around me clapt;<br />
The iron wicket, that defends the vault,<br />
Where the long race of Ptolemies is laid,<br />
Burst open, and disclosed the mighty dead.<br />
From out each monument, in order placed,<br />
An armed ghost starts up: The boy-king last<br />
Reared his inglorious head. A peal of groans<br />
Then followed, and a lamentable voice<br />
Cried,&mdash;"Egypt is no more!" My blood ran back,<br />
My shaking knees against each other knocked;<br />
On the cold pavement down I fell entranced,<br />
And so, unfinished, left the horrid scene.</p>
</div>

<p>Having quoted so many passages of exquisite poetry, and having
set this play in no unequal opposition to that of Shakespeare,
it is, perhaps, unnecessary to mention by what other poets the
same subject has been treated. Daniel, Mary countess of Pembroke,
May, and Sir Charles Sedley, each produced a play on
the fortunes of Anthony. Of these pieces I have never read the
three former, and will assuredly never read the last a second
time<a class="ftnt" href="#All_1-3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><a class="pgnm" id="page_294" name="page_294"></a>
"All for Love," as the most laboured performance of our author,
received the full tribute of applause and popularity which
had often graced his less perfect and more hurried performances.
Davies gives us the following account of its first representation.</p>

<p>"In Dryden's "All for Love," Booth's dignified action and
forcible elocution, in the part of Antony, attracted the public to
that heavy, though, in many parts, well written play, six night's
successively, without the assistance of pantomime, or farce,
which, at that time, was esteemed something extraordinary.&mdash;But,
indeed, he was well supported by an Oldfield, in his Cleopatra,
who, to a most harmonious and powerful voice, and fine
person, added grace and elegance of gesture. When Booth and
Oldfield met in the second act, their dignity of deportment commanded
the applause and approbation of the most judicious critics.
When Antony said to Cleopatra,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>You promised me your silence, and you break it</p>
<p>Ere I have scarce begun,&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">this check was so well understood by Oldfield, and answered with
such propriety of behaviour, that, in Shakespeare's phrase; her
"bendings were adornings."</p>

<p>"The elder Mills acted Ventidius with the true spirit of a rough
and generous old soldier. To render the play as acceptable to
the public as possible, Wilkes took the trifling part of Dolabella,
nor did Colley Cibber disdain to appear in Alexas. These parts
would scarcely be accepted now by third-rate actors. Still to
add more weight to the performance, Octavia was a short character
<a class="pgnm" id="page_295" name="page_295"></a>
of a scene or two, in which Mrs Porter drew not only respect,
but the more affecting approbation of tears from the audience.
Since that time, "All for Love" has gradually sunk into forgetfulness."</p>

<p>If this last observation be true, it is, under Mr Davies' favour, a
striking illustration of the caprice of the public taste. The play
of "All for Love" was first acted and printed in 1678.</p>

<p>"This passion, with the death of a dear friend, would go nigh to make one
sad;" yet some of the authors of the day held a very different doctrine.
Shadwell, in his dedication to "A true Widow," tells Sedley, "You have
in that Mulberry Garden shewn the true wit, humour, and satire of a comedy;
and, in Antony and Cleopatra, the true spirit of a tragedy;  the only one,
except two of Jonson's and one of Shakespeare's, wherein Romans are made
to speak and do like Romans. There are to be found the true characters of
Antony and Cleopatra, as they were; whereas a French author would have
made the Egyptian and Roman both become French under his pen. And
even our English authors are too much given to make history (in these plays)
romantic and impossible; but, in this play, the Romans are true Romans,
and their style is such; and I dare affirm, that there is not in any play of
this age so much of the spirit of the classic authors, as in your Antony and
Cleopatra." I cannot help suspecting that much of this hyperbolical praise
of Sedley was obliquely designed to mortify Dryden.</p></li>

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
THOMAS,<br />
EARL OF DANBY,
VISCOUNT LATIMER, AND BARON OSBORNE OF
KIVETON IN YORKSHIRE;<br />
LORD HIGH TREASURER OF ENGLAND,
ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY
COUNCIL, AND KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE
ORDER OF THE GARTER<a class="ftnt" href="#All_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noind smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>The gratitude of poets is so troublesome a virtue
to great men, that you are often in danger of your
own benefits: For you are threatened with some
epistle, and not suffered to do good in quiet, or to
<a class="pgnm" id="page_297" name="page_297"></a>
compound for their silence whom you have obliged.
Yet, I confess, I neither am or ought to be surprised
at this indulgence; for your lordship has the same
<a class="pgnm" id="page_298" name="page_298"></a>
right to favour poetry, which the great and noble
have ever had:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Carmen amat, quisquis carmine digna gerit.</p>
</div>

<p>There is somewhat of a tie in nature betwixt
those who are born for worthy actions, and those
who can transmit them to posterity; and though
ours be much the inferior part, it comes at least
within the verge of alliance; nor are we unprofitable
members of the commonwealth, when we animate
others to those virtues, which we copy and
describe from you.</p>

<p>It is indeed their interest, who endeavour the subversion
of governments, to discourage poets and historians;
for the best which can happen to them, is, to
be forgotten: But such who, under kings, are the
fathers of their country, and by a just and prudent
ordering of affairs preserve it, have the same reason
to cherish the chroniclers of their actions, as they
have to lay up in safety the deeds and evidences of
their estates; for such records are their undoubted
titles to the love and reverence of after-ages. Your
lordship's administration has already taken up a considerable
part of the English annals; and many of
its most happy years are owing to it. His majesty,
the most knowing judge of men, and the best master,
has acknowledged the ease and benefit he receives
in the incomes of his treasury, which you found
not only disordered, but exhausted. All things were
in the confusion of a chaos, without form or method
if not reduced beyond it, even to annihilation;
so that you had not only to separate the jarring elements,
but (if that boldness of expression might be
allowed me) to create them. Your enemies had so
embroiled the management of your office, that they
looked on your advancement as the instrument of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_299" name="page_299"></a>
your ruin. And as if the clogging of the revenue,
and the confusion of accounts, which you found in
your entrance, were not sufficient, they added their
own weight of malice to the public calamity, by
forestalling the credit which should cure it. Your
friends on the other side were only capable of pitying,
but not of aiding you; no farther help or counsel
was remaining to you, but what was founded on
yourself; and that indeed was your security; for
your diligence, your constancy, and your prudence,
wrought more surely within, when they were not
disturbed by any outward motion. The highest
virtue is best to be trusted with itself; for assistance
only can be given by a genius superior to that
which it assists; and it is the noblest kind of debt,
when we are only obliged to God and nature. This
then, my lord, is your just commendation, that you
have wrought out yourself a way to glory, by those
very means that were designed for your destruction:
You have not only restored, but advanced the revenues
of your master, without grievance to the
subject; and, as if that were little yet, the debts of
the exchequer, which lay heaviest both on the crown,
and on private persons, have by your conduct been
established in a certainty of satisfaction.<a class="ftnt" href="#All_2-2">[2]</a> An action
so much the more great and honourable, because
the case was without the ordinary relief of
laws; above the hopes of the afflicted, and beyond
the narrowness of the treasury to redress, had it
been managed by a less able hand. It is certainly
the happiest, and most unenvied part of all your
fortune, to do good to many, while you do injury
<a class="pgnm" id="page_300" name="page_300"></a>
to none; to receive at once the prayers of the subject,
and the praises of the prince; and, by the care
of your conduct, to give him means of exerting the
chiefest (if any be the chiefest) of his royal virtues,
his distributive justice to the deserving, and his
bounty and compassion to the wanting. The disposition
of princes towards their people cannot be
better discovered than in the choice of their ministers;
who, like the animal spirits betwixt the soul
and body, participate somewhat of both natures,
and make the communication which is betwixt them.
A king, who is just and moderate in his nature, who
rules according to the laws, whom God has made happy
by forming the temper of his soul to the constitution
of his government, and who makes us happy,
by assuming over us no other sovereignty than that
wherein our welfare and liberty consists; a prince,
I say, of so excellent a character, and so suitable
to the wishes of all good men, could not better have
conveyed himself into his people's apprehensions, than
in your lordship's person; who so lively express the
same virtues, that you seem not so much a copy, as
an emanation of him. Moderation is doubtless an
establishment of greatness; but there is a steadiness
of temper which is likewise requisite in a minister
of state; so equal a mixture of both virtues,
that he may stand like an isthmus betwixt the two
encroaching seas of arbitrary power, and lawless
anarchy. The undertaking would be difficult to any
but an extraordinary genius, to stand at the line,
and to divide the limits; to pay what is due to the
great representative of the nation, and neither to
enhance, nor to yield up, the undoubted prerogatives
of the crown. These, my lord, are the proper virtues
of a noble Englishman, as indeed they are
properly English virtues; no people in the world
being capable of using them, but we who have the
<a class="pgnm" id="page_301" name="page_301"></a>
happiness to be born under so equal, and so well
poised a government;&mdash;a government which has
all the advantages of liberty beyond a commonwealth,
and all the marks of kingly sovereignty,
without the danger of a tyranny. Both my nature,
as I am an Englishman, and my reason, as I am a
man, have bred in me a loathing to that specious
name of a republic; that mock appearance of a liberty,
where all who have not part in the government,
are slaves; and slaves they are of a viler
note, than such as are subjects to an absolute dominion.
For no Christian monarchy is so absolute,
but it is circumscribed with laws; but when the
executive power is in the law-makers, there is no
farther check upon them; and the people must suffer
without a remedy, because they are oppressed
by their representatives. If I must serve, the number
of my masters, who were born my equals, would
but add to the ignominy of my bondage. The nature
of our government, above all others, is exactly
suited both to the situation of our country, and the
temper of the natives; an island being more proper
for commerce and for defence, than for extending
its dominions on the Continent; for what the
valour of its inhabitants might gain, by reason of
its remoteness, and the casualties of the seas, it
could not so easily preserve: And, therefore, neither
the arbitrary power of One, in a monarchy, nor of
Many, in a commonwealth, could make us greater
than we are. It is true, that vaster and more frequent
taxes might be gathered, when the consent
of the people was not asked or needed; but this were
only by conquering abroad, to be poor at home; and
the examples of our neighbours teach us, that they
are not always the happiest subjects, whose kings extend
their dominions farthest. Since therefore we
cannot win by an offensive war, at least a land war,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_302" name="page_302"></a>
the model of our government seems naturally contrived
for the defensive part; and the consent of a
people is easily obtained to contribute to that power
which must protect it. <i>Felices nimium, bona si sua
n&oacute;rint, Angligen&aelig;!</i> And yet there are not wanting
malecontents amongst us, who, surfeiting themselves
on too much happiness, would persuade the
people that they might be happier by a change. It
was indeed the policy of their old forefather, when
himself was fallen from the station of glory, to seduce
mankind into the same rebellion with him, by
telling him he might yet be freer than he was; that
is, more free than his nature would allow, or, if I
may so say, than God could make him. We have
already all the liberty which free-born subjects can
enjoy, and all beyond it is but licence. But if it be
liberty of conscience which they pretend, the moderation
of our church is such, that its practice extends
not to the severity of persecution; and its
discipline is withal so easy, that it allows more freedom
to dissenters than any of the sects would allow
to it. In the mean time, what right can be
pretended by these men to attempt innovation in
church or state? Who made them the trustees, or,
to speak a little nearer their own language, the
keepers of the liberty of England? If their call be
extraordinary, let them convince us by working miracles;
for ordinary vocation they can have none,
to disturb the government under which they were
born, and which protects them. He who has often
changed his party, and always has made his interest
the rule of it, gives little evidence of his sincerity
for the public good; it is manifest he changes but
for himself, and takes the people for tools to work
his fortune. Yet the experience of all ages might
let him know, that they, who trouble the waters
first, have seldom the benefit of fishing; as they
<a class="pgnm" id="page_303" name="page_303"></a>
who began the late rebellion, enjoyed not the fruit
of their undertaking, but were crushed themselves
by the usurpation of their own instrument. Neither
is it enough for them to answer, that they only
intend a reformation of the government, but not
the subversion of it: on such pretence all insurrections
have been founded; it is striking at the
root of power, which is obedience. Every remonstrance
of private men has the seed of treason in it;
and discourses, which are couched in ambiguous
terms, are therefore the more dangerous, because
they do all the mischief of open sedition, yet are
safe from the punishment of the laws. These, my
lord, are considerations, which I should not pass so
lightly over, had I room to manage them as they
deserve; for no man can be so inconsiderable in a
nation, as not to have a share in the welfare of it;
and if he be a true Englishman, he must at the
same time be fired with indignation, and revenge
himself as he can on the disturbers of his country.
And to whom could I more fitly apply myself than
to your lordship, who have not only an inborn, but
an hereditary loyalty? The memorable constancy
and sufferings of your father, almost to the ruin of
his estate, for the royal cause, were an earnest of that,
which such a parent and such an institution would
produce in the person of a son. But so unhappy an
occasion of manifesting your own zeal, in suffering
for his present majesty, the providence of God, and
the prudence of your administration, will, I hope,
prevent; that, as your father's fortune waited on
the unhappiness of his sovereign, so your own may
participate of the better fate which attends his son.
The relation, which you have by alliance to the
noble family of your lady, serves to confirm to you
both this happy augury. For what can deserve a
greater place in the English chronicle, than the
<a class="pgnm" id="page_304" name="page_304"></a>
loyalty and courage, the actions and death, of the
general of an army, fighting for his prince and country?
The honour and gallantry of the earl of Lindsey
is so illustrious a subject, that it is fit to adorn
an heroic poem; for he was the proto-martyr of the
cause, and the type of his unfortunate royal master<a class="ftnt" href="#All_2-3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet after all, my lord, if I may speak my thoughts,
you are happy rather to us than to yourself; for the
multiplicity, the cares, and the vexations of your
employment, have betrayed you from yourself, and
given you up into the possession of the public.
You are robbed of your privacy and friends, and
scarce any hour of your life you can call your own.
Those, who envy your fortune, if they wanted not
good-nature, might more justly pity it; and when
they see you watched by a crowd of suitors, whose
importunity it is impossible to avoid, would conclude,
with reason, that you have lost much more
in true content, than you have gained by dignity;
and that a private gentleman is better attended by
a single servant, than your lordship with so clamorous
a train. Pardon me, my lord, if I speak like a
philosopher on this subject; the fortune, which
makes a man uneasy, cannot make him happy; and
a wise man must think himself uneasy, when few
of his actions are in his choice.</p>

<p><a class="pgnm" id="page_305" name="page_305"></a>
This last consideration has brought me to another,
and a very seasonable one for your relief;
which is, that while I pity your want of leisure, I
have impertinently detained you so long a time. I
have put off my own business, which was my dedication,
till it is so late, that I am now ashamed to
begin it; and therefore I will say nothing of the
poem, which I present to you, because I know not
if you are like to have an hour, which, with a good
conscience, you may throw away in perusing it;
and for the author, I have only to beg the continuance
of your protection to him, who is,</p>

<p class="sig i1">My Lord,</p>
<p class="sig i2">Your Lordship's most obliged,</p>
<p class="sig i3">Most humble, and</p>
<p class="sig i4">Most obedient, servant,</p>

Thomas Osburne, a Baronet of good family, and decayed estate;
part of which had been lost in the royal cause. He was of a bold
undaunted character, and stood high for the prerogative. Hence
he was thought worthy of being sworn into the Privy Council
during the administration of the famous CABAL; and when that
was dissolved by the secession of Shaftesbury and the resignation
of Clifford, he was judged a proper person to succeed the latter
as Lord High Treasurer. He was created Earl of Danby, and
was supposed to be deeply engaged in the attempt to new-model
our Constitution on a more arbitrary plan; having been even heard
to say, when sitting in judgment, that a new proclamation from
the Crown was superior to an old act of Parliament. Nevertheless,
he was persecuted as well by the faction of the Duke of York, to
whom he was odious for having officiously introduced the famous Popish
plot to the consideration of parliament, as by the popular party,
who hated him as a favourite minister. Accordingly, in 1678, he was
impeached by a vote of the House of Commons, and in consequence,
notwithstanding the countenance of the King, was deprived of all
his offices, and finally committed to the tower, where he remained for
four years. Sir John Reresby has these reflections on Lord Danby's
greatness and sudden fall: "It was but a few months before, that
few things were transacted at court, but with the privity or consent
of this great man; the King's brother, and favourite mistress,
were glad to be fair with him, and the general address of all men
of business was to him, who was not only treasurer, but prime
minister also, who not only kept the purse, but was the first, and
greatest confident in all affairs of state. But now he is neglected
of all, forced to hide his head as a criminal, and in danger of losing
all he has got, and his life therewith: His family, raised from privacy
to the degree of Marquis, (a patent was then actually passing
to invest him with that dignity) is now on the brink of falling below
the humble stand of a yeoman; nor would almost the meanest
subject change conditions with him now, whom so very lately the
greatest beheld with envy." <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 85.</p>

<p>As he was obnoxious to all parties, Lord Danby would probably
have been made a sacrifice, had not the disturbances, which
arose from the various plots of the time, turned the attention of
his enemies to other subjects. He was liberated in 1683-4, survived
the Revolution, was created Duke of Leeds, and died in 1712.
His character was of the most decided kind; he was fertile in expedients
and had always something new to substitute for those which
failed; a faculty highly acceptable to Charles, who loved to be relieved
even were it but in idea, from the labour of business, and the
pressure of difficulty. In other points, he was probably not very
scrupulous, since even Dryden found cause to say at length, that<br /><br /></p>

<h3 class="chap">PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The death of Antony and Cleopatra is a subject
which has been treated by the greatest wits of
our nation, after Shakespeare; and by all so variously,
that their example has given me the confidence
to try myself in this bow of Ulysses amongst the
crowd of shooters; and, withal, to take my own
measures, in aiming at the mark. I doubt not but
the same motive has prevailed with all of us in this
attempt; I mean the excellency of the moral: For
the chief persons represented, were famous patterns
of unlawful love; and their end accordingly was unfortunate.
All reasonable men have long since concluded,
that the hero of the poem ought not to be
a character of perfect virtue, for then he could not,
without injustice, be made unhappy; nor yet altogether
wicked, because he could not then be pitied.
I have therefore steered the middle course; and have
drawn the character of Antony as favourably as
Plutarch, Appian, and Dion Cassius would give me
leave; the like I have observed in Cleopatra. That
which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater
heighth, was not afforded me by the story; for the
crimes of love, which they both committed, were
not occasioned by any necessity, or fatal ignorance,
but were wholly voluntary; since our passions are,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_307" name="page_307"></a>
or ought to be, within our power. The fabric of
the play is regular enough, as to the inferior parts
of it; and the unities of time, place, and action,
more exactly observed, than perhaps the English
theatre requires. Particularly, the action is so much
one, that it is the only of the kind without episode,
or underplot; every scene in the tragedy conducing
to the main design, and every act concluding with
a turn of it. The greatest error in the contrivance
seems to be in the person of Octavia; for, though
I might use the privilege of a poet, to introduce her
into Alexandria, yet I had not enough considered,
that the compassion she moved to herself and children,
was destructive to that which I reserved for
Antony and Cleopatra; whose mutual love being
founded upon vice, must lessen the favour of the
audience to them, when virtue and innocence were
oppressed by it. And, though I justified Antony in
some measure, by making Octavia's departure to
proceed wholly from herself; yet the force of the
first machine still remained; and the dividing of
pity, like the cutting of a river into many channels,
abated the strength of the natural stream. But this
is an objection which none of my critics have urged
against me; and therefore I might have let it pass,
if I could have resolved to have been partial to myself.
The faults my enemies have found, are rather
cavils concerning little and not essential decencies;
which a master of the ceremonies may decide betwixt
us. The French poets, I confess, are strict observers
of these punctilios: They would not, for example,
have suffered Cleopatra and Octavia to have met; or,
if they had met, there must have only passed betwixt
them some cold civilities, but no eagerness of repartee,
for fear of offending against the greatness
of their characters, and the modesty of their sex.
This objection I foresaw, and at the same time contemned;
<a class="pgnm" id="page_308" name="page_308"></a>
for I judged it both natural and probable,
that Octavia, proud of her new-gained conquest,
would search out Cleopatra to triumph over her;
and that Cleopatra thus attacked, was not of a spirit
to shun the encounter: And it is not unlikely,
that two exasperated rivals should use such satire as
I have put into their mouths; for, after all, though
the one were a Roman, and the other a queen, they
were both women. It is true, some actions, though
natural, are not fit to be represented; and broad obscenities
in words, ought in good manners to be
avoided: expressions therefore are a modest clothing
of our thoughts, as breeches and petticoats are
of our bodies. If I have kept myself within the
bounds of modesty, all beyond it is but nicety and
affectation; which is no more but modesty depraved
into a vice. They betray themselves, who are too
quick of apprehension in such cases, and leave all
reasonable men to imagine worse of them, than of
the poet.</p>

<p>Honest Montaigne goes yet farther: <i>Nous ne
sommes que ceremonie; la ceremonie nous emporte, et
laissons la substance des choses: Nous nous tenons aux
branches, et abandonnons le tronc et le corps. Nous
avons appris aux dames de rougir, oyans seulement
nommer ce qu'elles ne craignent aucunement &agrave; faire;
Nous n'esons appeller &agrave; droict nos membres, et ne craignons
pas de les employer &agrave; toute sorte de debauche. La
ceremonie nous defend d'exprimer par paroles les choses
licites et naturelles, et nous l'en croyons; la raison nous
defend de n'en faire point d'illicites et mauvaises, et
personne ne l'en croit.</i> My comfort is, that by this
opinion my enemies are but sucking critics, who
would fain be nibbling ere their teeth are come.</p>

<p>Yet, in this nicety of manners does the excellency
of French poetry consist. Their heroes are the
most civil people breathing; but their good breeding
<a class="pgnm" id="page_309" name="page_309"></a>
seldom extends to a word of sense; all their
wit is in their ceremony; they want the genius
which animates our stage; and therefore it is but
necessary, when they cannot please, that they should
take care not to offend. But as the civillest man
in the company is commonly the dullest, so these
authors, while they are afraid to make you laugh or
cry, out of pure good manners, make you sleep.
They are so careful not to exasperate a critic, that
they never leave him any work; so busy with the
broom, and make so clean a riddance, that there is
little left either for censure or for praise: For no
part of a poem is worth our discommending, where
the whole is insipid; as when we have once tasted
of palled wine, we stay not to examine it glass by
glass. But while they affect to shine in trifles, they
are often careless in essentials. Thus, their Hippolitus
is so scrupulous in point of decency, that he
will rather expose himself to death, than accuse his
step-mother to his father; and my critics I am sure
will commend him for it: But we of grosser apprehensions
are apt to think, that this excess of generosity
is not practicable, but with fools and madmen.
This was good manners with a vengeance;
and the audience is like to be much concerned at
the misfortunes of this admirable hero. But take
Hippolitus out of his poetic fit, and I suppose he
would think it a wiser part, to set the saddle on the
right horse, and chuse rather to live with the reputation
of a plain-spoken honest man, than to die
with the infamy of an incestuous villain.<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-1">[1]</a> In the
<a class="pgnm" id="page_310" name="page_310"></a>
mean time we may take notice, that where the poet
ought to have preserved the character as it was delivered
to us by antiquity, when he should have
given us the picture of a rough young man, of the
Amazonian strain, a jolly huntsman, and both by
his profession and his early rising a mortal enemy
to love, he has chosen to give him the turn of gallantry
sent him to travel from Athens to Paris,
taught him to make love, and transformed the Hippolitus
of Euripides into Monsieur Hippolite. I should
not have troubled myself thus far with French poets,
but that I find our <i>Chedreux</i><a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-2">[2]</a> critics wholly form
<a class="pgnm" id="page_311" name="page_311"></a>
their judgments by them. But for my part, I desire
to be tried by the laws of my own country; for
it seems unjust to me, that the French should prescribe
here, till they have conquered. Our little
sonetteers, who follow them, have too narrow souls
to judge of poetry. Poets themselves are the most
proper, though I conclude not the only critics. But
till some genius, as universal as Aristotle, shall arise,
one who can penetrate into all arts and sciences,
without the practice of them, I shall think it reasonable
that the judgment of an artificer in his own
art should be preferable to the opinion of another
man; at least where he is not bribed by interest,
or prejudiced by malice. And this, I suppose, is manifest
by plain inductions: For, first, the crowd cannot
be presumed to have more than a gross instinct,
of what pleases or displeases them: Every man will
grant me this; but then, by a particular kindness
to himself, he draws his own stake first, and will be
distinguished from the multitude, of which other
men may think him one. But, if I come closer to
those who are allowed for witty men, either by the
advantage of their quality, or by common fame,
and affirm that neither are they qualified to decide
sovereignly concerning poetry, I shall yet have a
strong party of my opinion; for most of them severally
will exclude the rest, either from the number
<a class="pgnm" id="page_312" name="page_312"></a>
of witty men, or at least of able judges. But here
again they are all indulgent to themselves; and
every one who believes himself a wit, that is, every
man, will pretend at the same time to a right judgeing.
But to press it yet farther, there are many
witty men, but few poets; neither have all poets a
taste of tragedy. And this is the rock on which they
are daily splitting. Poetry, which is a picture of nature,
must generally please; but it is not to be understood
that all parts of it must please every man; therefore
is not tragedy to be judged by a witty man, whose
taste is only confined to comedy. Nor is every man
who loves tragedy, a sufficient judge of it; he must
understand the excellencies of it too, or he will
only prove a blind admirer, not a critic. From hence
it comes that so many satires on poets, and censures
of their writings, fly abroad. Men of pleasant conversation,
(at least esteemed so) and endued with a
trifling kind of fancy, perhaps helped out with
some smattering of Latin, are ambitious to distinguish
themselves from the herd of gentlemen,
by their poetry;</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Rarus enim ferm&egrave;; sensus communis in ill&acirc;</p>
<p>Fortun&acirc;.</p>
</div>

<p>And is not this a wretched affectation, not to be
contented with what fortune has done for them, and
sit down quietly with their estates, but they must
call their wits in question, and needlessly expose
their nakedness to public view? Not considering
that they are not to expect the same approbation
from sober men, which they have found from their
flatterers after the third bottle. If a little glittering
in discourse has passed them on us for witty men,
where was the necessity of undeceiving the world?
Would a man who has an ill title to an estate, but
<a class="pgnm" id="page_313" name="page_313"></a>
yet is in possession of it; would he bring it of his
own accord, to be tried at Westminster? We who
write, if we want the talent, yet have the excuse
that we do it for a poor subsistence; but what can
be urged in their defence, who, not having the vocation
of poverty to scribble, out of mere wantonness
take pains to make themselves ridiculous? Horace
was certainly in the right, where he said, "That
no man is satisfied with his own condition." A poet
is not pleased, because he is not rich; and the rich
are discontented, because the poets will not admit
them of their number. Thus the case is hard with
writers: If they succeed not, they must starve; and
if they do, some malicious satire is prepared to level
them, for daring to please without their leave. But
while they are so eager to destroy the fame of others,
their ambition is manifest in their concernment;
some poem of their own is to lie produced, and the
slaves are to be laid flat with their faces on the
ground, that the monarch may appear in the greater
majesty<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Dionysius and Nero had the same longing, but with
all their power they could never bring their business
well about. 'Tis true, they proclaimed themselves
poets by sound of trumpet; and poets they were, upon
<a class="pgnm" id="page_314" name="page_314"></a>
pain of death to any man who durst call them otherwise.
The audience had a fine time on't, you may
imagine; they sat in a bodily fear, and looked as
demurely as they could: for it was a hanging matter
to laugh unseasonably; and the tyrants were suspicious,
as they had reason, that their subjects had them
in the wind; so, every man, in his own defence, set
as good a face upon the business as he could. It was
known before-hand that the monarchs were to be
crowned laureats; but when the show was over,
and an honest man was suffered to depart quietly,
he took out his laughter which he had stifled; with
a firm resolution never more to see an emperor's
play, though he had been ten years a making it. In
the mean time the true poets were they who made
the best markets, for they had wit enough to yield
the prize with a good grace, and not contend with
him who had thirty legions<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-4">[4]</a>. They were sure to
be rewarded, if they confessed themselves bad writers,
and that was somewhat better than to be martyrs
for their reputation. Lucan's example was enough
to teach them manners; and after he was put to
death, for overcoming Nero, the emperor carried it
without dispute for the best poet in his dominions.
No man was ambitious of that grinning honour;
for if he heard the malicious trumpeter proclaiming
his name before his betters, he knew there was but
one way with him. Mec&aelig;nas took another course,
and we know he was more than a great man, for
he was witty too: But finding himself far gone in
poetry, which Seneca assures us was not his talent,
<a class="pgnm" id="page_315" name="page_315"></a>
he thought it his best way to be well with Virgil
and with Horace; that at least he might be a poet
at the second hand; and we see how happily it has
succeeded with him; for his own bad poetry is forgotten,
and their panegyricks of him still remain.
But they who should be our patrons, are for no such
expensive ways to fame; they have much of the
poetry of Mec&aelig;nas, but little of his liberality. They
are for persecuting Horace and Virgil, in the persons
of their successors; for such is every man, who has
any part of their soul and fire, though in a less degree.
Some of their little zanies yet go farther;
for they are persecutors even of Horace himself; as
far as they are able, by their ignorant and vile imitations
of him; by making an unjust use of his authority
and turning his artillery against his friends.
But how would he disdain to be copied by such
hands! I dare answer for him, he would be more
uneasy in their company, than he was with Crispinus,
their forefather, in the Holy Way; and would no
more have allowed them a place amongst the critics,
than he would Demetrius the mimic, and Tigellius
the buffoon;</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Demetri, teque, Tigelli,</p>
<p>Discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras.</p>
</div>

<p>With what scorn would he look down on such miserable
translators, who make doggrel of his Latin,
mistake his meaning, mis-apply his censures, and
often contradict their own? He is fixed as a landmark
to set out the bounds of poetry:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Saxum antiquum, ingens,&mdash;</p>
<p>Limes agro positus, litem ut discerneret arvis.</p>
</div>

<p>But other arms than theirs, and other sinews
are required, to raise the weight of such an author;
<a class="pgnm" id="page_316" name="page_316"></a>
and when they would toss him against their
enemies,</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Genua labant, gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis.</p>
<p>Tum lapis ipse, viri vacuum per inane volutus,</p>
<p>Nec spatium evasit totum, nec pertulit ictum<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-5">[5]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For my part, I would wish no other revenge, either
for myself, or the rest of the poets, from this rhyming
judge of the twelve-penny gallery, this legitimate
son of Sternhold, than that he would subscribe
his name to his censure, or (not to tax him beyond
his learning) set his mark: For, should he own himself
publicly, and come from behind the lion's skin,
they, whom he condemns, would be thankful to him,
they, whom he praises, would chuse to be condemned;
and the magistrates, whom he has elected, would
modestly withdraw from their employment, to avoid
the scandal of his nomination<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-6">[6]</a>. The sharpness of
<a class="pgnm" id="page_317" name="page_317"></a>
his satire, next to himself, falls most heavily on his
friends, and they ought never to forgive him for
commending them perpetually the wrong way, and
sometimes by contraries. If he have a friend, whose
hastiness in writing is his greatest fault, Horace
would have taught him to have minced the matter,
and to have called it readiness of thought, and a
flowing fancy; for friendship will allow a man to
christen an imperfection by the name of some neighbour
virtue;</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Vellem in amiciti&acirc; sic erraremus; et isti</p>
<p>Errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">But he would never have allowed him to have called
a slow man hasty, or a hasty writer a slow drudge<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-7">[7]</a>,
as Juvenal explains it:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Canibus pigris, scabieque vetust&acirc;</p>
<p>L&aelig;vibus, et sicc&aelig; lambentibus ora lucern&aelig;,</p>
<p>Nomen erit, Pardus, Tygris, Leo; si quid adhuc est</p>
<p>Quod fremit in terris violentius<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-8">[8]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><a class="pgnm" id="page_318" name="page_318"></a>
Yet Lucretius laughs at a foolish lover, even for excusing
the imperfections of his mistress:</p>

<div class="poem pi">

</div>

<p>But to drive it <i>ad &AElig;thiopem cygnum</i> is not to be
endured. I leave him to interpret this by the benefit
of his French version on the other side, and
without farther considering him, than I have the
rest of my illiterate censors, whom I have disdained
to answer, because they are not qualified for
judges. It remains that I acquaint the reader, that
I have endeavoured in this play to follow the practice
of the ancients, who, as Mr Rymer has judiciously
observed, are and ought to be our masters<a class="ftnt" href="#All_3-9">[9]</a>.
Horace likewise gives it for a rule in his art of
poetry.</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;Vos exemplaria Gr&aelig;ca</p>
<p>Nocturn&acirc; versate manu, versate diurn&acirc;.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, though their models are regular, they are
too little for English tragedy; which requires to
be built in a larger compass. I could give an instance
in the "Oedipus Tyrannus," which was the
master piece of Sophocles; but I reserve it for a
<a class="pgnm" id="page_319" name="page_319"></a>
more fit occasion, which I hope to have hereafter.
In my style, I have professed to imitate
the divine Shakespeare; which that I might perform
more freely, I have disincumbered myself
from rhyme. Not that I condemn my former
way, but that this is more proper to my present
purpose. I hope I need not to explain myself,
that I have not copied my author servilely: Words
and phrases must of necessity receive a change in
succeeding ages; but it is almost a miracle that much
of his language remains so pure; and that he who
began dramatic poetry amongst us, untaught by
any, and, as Ben Jonson tells us, without learning,
should by the force of his own genius perform so
much, that in a manner he has left no praise for any
who come after him. The occasion is fair, and the
subject would be pleasant to handle the difference
of styles betwixt him and Fletcher, and wherein,
and how far they are both to be imitated. But
since I must not be over-confident of my own performance
after him, it will be prudence in me to
be silent. Yet, I hope, I may affirm, and without
vanity, that, by imitating him, I have excelled myself
throughout the play; and particularly, that I
prefer the scene betwixt Antony and Ventidius in
the first act, to any thing which I have written in
this kind.</p>

<li><a id="All_3-2" name="All_3-2"></a><i>Chedreux</i> was the name of the fashionable periwigs of the
day, and appears to have been derived from their maker. A
French <i>peruqirier</i>, in one of Shadwell's comedies, says, "You
talke of de Chedreux; he is no bodie to me. Dere is no man can
travaille vis mee. Monsieur Wildish has got my peruke on his
head. Let me see, here is de haire, de curie, de brucle, ver
good, ver good. If dat foole Chedreux make de peruke like me,
I vil be hanga." Bury Fair, Act I. Scene II. It appears from
the letter of the literary veteran in the Gentleman's Magazine for
1745, that our author, as he advanced in reputation, assumed
the fashionable <i>Chedreux</i> periwig.</li>

<li><a id="All_3-3" name="All_3-3"></a>This passage though, doubtless applicable to many of the men
of rank at the court of Charles II., was particularly levelled
at Lord Rochester with whom our author was now on bad
terms. It is hardly fair to enquire how far this description of the
discourse and talents of a person of wit and honour agrees with
that given in the dedication to Marriage a-la-Mode, when, in
compliment to the same nobleman, we are told, that, "Wit seems
to have lodged itself more nobly in this age, than in any of the
former; and that his lordship had but another step to make,
from the patron of wit, to become its tyrant." This last observation
seems to have been made in the spirit of prophecy.</li>

<li><a id="All_3-4" name="All_3-4"></a>Such is said to have been the answer of a philosopher to a
friend, who upbraided him with giving up a dispute to the Emperor
Adrian.</li>

<li><a id="All_3-5" name="All_3-5"></a>This passage alludes to an imitation of Horace, quaintly entitled
an "Allusion to the Tenth Satire of his First Book" which was the
production of Rochester. As however it appeared without a name,
it may have been for a time imputed to some of the inferior wits,
whom his Lordship patronized. It contains a warm attack on
Dryden, part of which has been already quoted. Dryden probably
knew the real author of this satire, although he chose to impute
it to one of the "Zanies" of the great. At least it seems
unlikely that he should take Crown for the author, as has been supposed
by Mr Malone; for in the imitation we have these lines:<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>For by that rule I might as well admit</p>
<p>Crown's heavy scenes for poetry and wit.</p>
</div>

<p>Crown could hardly be charged as author of a poem, in which
this sarcasm occurred.</p></li>

<li><a id="All_3-6" name="All_3-6"></a>Alluding probably to the concluding lines of the Satire.<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>I loath the rabble; 'tis enough for me</p>
<p>If Sedley, Shadwell, Shepherd, Wycherley,</p>
<p>Godolphin, Butler, Buckhurst, Buckingham,</p>
<p>And some few more whom I omit to name,</p>
<p>Approve my sense; I count their censure fame.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="All_3-7" name="All_3-7"></a>Dryden alludes to the censure past on himself, where it is
said,<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>Five hundred verses in a morning writ.</p>
<p>Prove him no more a poet than a wit.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="All_3-8" name="All_3-8"></a>This refers to the characters of Shadwell and Wycherley, which
according to Dryden, the satirist seems to have misunderstood.<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>Of all our modern wits, none seems to me</p>
<p>Once to have touched upon true comedy,</p>
<p>But hasty Shadwell and slow Wycherley;</p>
<p>Shadwell's unfinished works do yet impart</p>
<p>Great proofs of force of nature, none of art.</p>
<p>With just bold strokes he dashes here and there,</p>
<p>Shewing great mastery with little care;</p>
<p>But Wycherley earns hard whate'er he gains,</p>
<p>He wants no judgment, and he spares no pains;</p>
<p>He frequently excels, and, at the least,</p>
<p>Makes fewer faults than any of the rest.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="All_3-9" name="All_3-9"></a>"I have chiefly considered the fable, or plot, which all conclude
to be the soul of a tragedy, which, with the ancients, is all
ways to be found a reasonable soul, but with us, for the most
part, a brutish, and often worse than brutish.

<p>"And certainly there is not required much learning, or that a
man must be some Aristotle and doctor of subtilties, to form a
right judgement in this particular; common sense suffices; and
rarely have I known women-judges mistaken in these points, where
they have patience to think; and left to their own heads, they decide
with their own sense. But if people are prepossessed, if they
will judge of Rollo by Othello, and one crooked line by another,
we can never have a certainty."</p>

<h3 class="chap">PROLOGUE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>What flocks of critics hover here to-day,</p>
<p>As vultures wait on armies for their prey,</p>
<p>All gaping for the carcase of a play!</p>
<p>With croaking notes they bode some dire event,</p>
<p>And follow dying poets by the scent.</p>
<p>Ours gives himself for gone; you've watched your time:</p>
<p>He fights this day unarmed,&mdash;without his rhyme;&mdash;</p>
<p>And brings a tale which often has been told;</p>
<p>As sad as Dido's; and almost as old.</p>
<p>His hero, whom you wits his bully call,</p>
<p>Bates of his mettle, and scarce rants at all:</p>
<p>He's somewhat lewd; but a well-meaning mind;</p>
<p>Weeps much; fights little; but is wond'rous kind.</p>
<p>In short, a pattern, and companion fit,</p>
<p>For all the keeping tonies of the pit.</p>
<p>I could name more: a wife, and mistress too;</p>
<p>Both (to be plain) too good for most of you:</p>
<p>The wife well-natured, and the mistress true.</p>
<p>  Now, poets, if your fame has been his care,</p>
<p>Allow him all the candour you can spare.</p>
<p>A brave man scorns to quarrel once a-day;</p>
<p>Like Hectors, in at every petty fray.</p>
<p>Let those find fault whose wit's so very small,</p>
<p>They've need to show that they can think at all;</p>
<p>Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow;</p>
<p>He who would search for pearls, must dive below.</p>
<p>Fops may have leave to level all they can;</p>
<p>As pigmies would be glad to lop a man.</p>
<p>Half-wits are fleas; so little and so light,</p>
<p>We scarce could know they live, but that they bite.</p>
<p>But, as the rich, when tired with daily feasts,</p>
<p>For change, become their next poor tenant's guests;</p>
<p>Drink hearty draughts of ale from plain brown bowls,</p>
<p>And snatch the homely rasher from the coals:</p>
<p>So you, retiring from much better cheer,</p>
<p>For once, may venture to do penance here.</p>
<p>And since that plenteous autumn now is past,</p>
<p>Whose grapes and peaches have indulged your taste,</p>
<p>Take in good part, from our poor poet's board,</p>
<p>Such rivelled fruits as winter can afford.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ser.</span> Portents and prodigies have grown so frequent,<br />
That they have lost their name. Our fruitful Nile<br />
Flowed ere the wonted season, with a torrent<br />
So unexpected, and so wondrous fierce,<br />
That the wild deluge overtook the haste<br />
Even of the hinds that watched it: Men and beasts<br />
Were borne above the tops of trees, that grew<br />
On the utmost margin of the water-mark.<br />
Then, with so swift an ebb the flood drove backward,<br />
It slipt from underneath the scaly herd:<br />
Here monstrous phoc&aelig;; panted on the shore;<br />
Forsaken dolphins there, with their broad tails<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_324" name="page_324"></a>
Lay lashing the departing waves: hard by them,<br />
Sea-horses floundring in the slimy mud,<br />
Tossed up their heads, and dashed the ooze about them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Myr.</span> Avert these omens, Heaven!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ser.</span> Last night, between the hours of twelve and one,<br />
In a lone aisle of the temple while I walked,<br />
A whirlwind rose, that, with a violent blast,<br />
Shook all the dome: the doors around me clapt;<br />
The iron wicket, that defends the vault,<br />
Where the long race of Ptolemies is laid,<br />
Burst open, and disclosed the mighty dead.<br />
From out each monument, in order placed,<br />
An armed ghost starts up: the boy-king last<br />
Reared his inglorious head. A peal of groans<br />
Then followed, and a lamentable voice<br />
Cried, Egypt is no more. My blood ran back,<br />
My shaking knees against each other knocked;<br />
On the cold pavement down I fell entranced,<br />
And so unfinished left the horrid scene.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> And dreamed you this? or did invent the story,
<span class="sdr">[Shewing himself.</span><br />
To frighten our Egyptian boys withal,<br />
And train them up, betimes, in fear of priesthood?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> My lord, I saw you not,<br />
Nor meant my words should reach your ears; but what<br />
I uttered was most true.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> A foolish dream,<br />
Bred from the fumes of indigested feasts,<br />
And holy luxury.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> I know my duty:<br />
This goes no farther.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> 'Tis not fit it should;<br />

<a class="pgnm" id="page_325" name="page_325"></a>
All southern, from yon hills, the Roman camp<br />
Hangs o'er us black and threatning, like a storm<br />
Just breaking on our heads.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> Our faint Egyptians pray for Antony;<br />
But in their servile hearts they own Octavius.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Myr.</span> Why then does Antony dream out his hours,<br />
And tempts not fortune for a noble day,<br />
Which might redeem what Actium lost?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> He thinks 'tis past recovery.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> Yet the foe<br />
Seems not to press the siege.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> O, there's the wonder.<br />
Mec&aelig;nas and Agrippa, who can most<br />
With C&aelig;sar, are his foes. His wife Octavia,<br />
Driven from his house, solicits her revenge;<br />
And Dolabella, who was once his friend,<br />
Upon some private grudge, now seeks his ruin:<br />
Yet still war seems on either side to sleep.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> 'Tis strange that Antony, for some days past,<br />
Has not beheld the face of Cleopatra;<br />
But here, in Isis temple, lives retired,<br />
And makes his heart a prey to black despair.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> 'Tis true; and we much fear he hopes by absence<br />
To cure his mind of love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> If he be vanquished,<br />
Or make his peace, Egypt is doomed to be<br />
A Roman province; and our plenteous harvests<br />
Must then redeem the scarceness of their soil.<br />
While Antony stood firm, our Alexandria<br />
Rivalled proud Rome, (dominion's other seat)<br />
And Fortune striding, like a vast Colossus,<br />
Could fix an equal foot of empire here.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> Had I my wish, these tyrants of all nature,<br />
Who lord it o'er mankind, should perish,&mdash;perish,<br />
Each by the other's sword; but, since our will<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_326" name="page_326"></a>
Is lamely followed by our power, we must<br />
Depend on one; with him to rise or fall.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> How stands the queen affected?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> O she dotes,<br />
She dotes, Serapion, on this vanquished man,<br />
And winds herself about his mighty ruins;<br />
Whom would she yet forsake, yet yield him up,<br />
This hunted prey, to his pursuer's hands,<br />
She might preserve us all: but 'tis in vain&mdash;<br />
This changes my designs, this blasts my counsels,<br />
And makes me use all means to keep him here,<br />
Whom I could wish divided from her arms,<br />
Far as the earth's deep centre. Well, you know<br />
The state of things; no more of your ill omens<br />
And black prognostics; labour to confirm<br />
The people's hearts.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> These Romans will o'erhear us.<br />

He's of no vulgar note.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> O 'tis Ventidius,<br />
Our emperor's great lieutenant in the East,<br />
Who first showed Rome that Parthia could be conquered.<br />
When Antony returned from Syria last,<br />
He left this man to guard the Roman frontiers.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Serap.</span> You seem to know him well.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> Too well. I saw him in Cilicia first,<br />
When Cleopatra there met Antony:<br />
A mortal foe he was to us, and Egypt.<br />
But,&mdash;let me witness to the worth I hate,&mdash;<br />
A braver Roman never drew a sword;<br />
Firm to his prince, but as a friend, not slave.<br />
He ne'er was of his pleasures; but presides<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_327" name="page_327"></a>
O'er all his cooler hours, and morning counsels:<br />
In short, the plainness, fierceness, rugged virtue,<br />

Sometimes he gnaws his lip, and curses loud<br />

So soon, when I so far have come to see you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Now thou hast seen me, art thou satified?<br />

Fortune came smiling to my youth, and wooed it,<br />

When first I came to empire, I was borne<br />
On tides of people, crowding to my triumphs;<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_334" name="page_334"></a>
The wish of nations, and the willing world<br />
Received me as its pledge of future peace;<br />
I was so great, so happy, so beloved,<br />
Fate could not ruin me; till I took pains,<br />
And worked against my fortune, chid her from me,<br />
And turned her loose; yet still she came again.<br />
My careless days, and my luxurious nights,<br />
At length have wearied her, and now she's gone,<br />
Gone, gone, divorced for ever. Help me, soldier,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> I have, to the utmost. Dost thou think me desperate,<br />
Without just cause? No, when I found all lost<br />
Beyond repair, I hid me from the world,<br />

So heartily, I think it is not worth<br />
The cost of keeping.</p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_336" name="page_336"></a>
<span class="cnm">Vent.</span> They would perhaps desire<br />
A better reason.</p>

My soldiers to demand a reason of<br />
My actions. Why did they refuse to march?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> They said they would not fight for Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> What was't they said?</p>

Why should they fight indeed, to make her conquer,<br />

So perfect, that the gods, who formed you, wondered<br />
At their own skill, and cried,&mdash;A lucky hit<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> I am no queen:<br />
Is this to be a queen, to be besieged<br />
By yon insulting Roman, and to wait<br />
Each hour the victor's chain? These ills are small;<br />
For Antony is lost, and I can mourn<br />
For nothing else but him. Now come, Octavius,<br />
I have no more to lose; prepare thy bands;<br />
I'm fit to be a captive: Antony<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Iras.</span> Call reason to assist you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> I have none,<br />
And none would have: My love's a noble madness,<br />
Which shows the cause deserved it. Moderate sorrow<br />
Fits vulgar love, and for a vulgar man:<br />
But I have loved with such transcendent passion,<br />
I soared, at first, quite out of reason's view,<br />
And now am lost above it. No, I'm proud<br />
'Tis thus: Would Antony could see me now!<br />
Think you he would not sigh, though he must leave me?<br />
Sure he would sigh; for he is noble-natured,<br />
And bears a tender heart: I know him well.<br />
Ah, no, I know him not; I knew him once,<br />
But now 'tis past.</p>

Forget him, madam.</p>

<p class="dlg">Now, what news, my Charmion?<br />
Will he be kind? and will he not forsake me?<br />

And in the words he spoke.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Char.</span> I found him, then,<br />
Encompassed round, I think, with iron statues;<br />
So mute, so motionless his soldiers stood,<br />
While awfully he cast his eyes about,<br />
And every leader's hopes or fears surveyed:<br />
Methought he looked resolved, and yet not pleased.<br />
When he beheld me struggling in the crowd,<br />
He blushed, and bade make way.</p>

Severely, as he meant to frown me back,<br />
And sullenly gave place: I told my message,<br />
Just as you gave it, broken and disordered;<br />
I numbered in it all your sighs and tears,<br />
And while I moved your pitiful request,<br />
That you but only begged a last farewell,<br />
He fetched an inward groan; and every time<br />
I named you, sighed, as if his heart were breaking.<br />
But, shunned my eyes, and guiltily looked down:<br />
He seemed not now that awful Antony,<br />
Who shook an armed assembly with his nod;<br />
But, making show as he would rub his eyes,<br />
Disguised and blotted out a falling tear.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Did he then weep? And was I worth a tear?<br />
If what thou hast to say be not as pleasing,<br />
Tell me no more, but let me die contented.</p>

He could deny you nothing, if he saw you;<br />

Respect you, as he ought.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Is that a word<br />
For Antony to use to Cleopatra?<br />
Oh that faint word, <i>respect</i>! how I disdain it!<br />
Disdain myself, for loving after it!<br />
He should have kept that word for cold Octavia.<br />
Respect is for a wife: Am I that thing,<br />
That dull insipid lump, without desires,<br />
And without power to give them?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> You misjudge;<br />
You see through love, and that deludes your sight;<br />
As, what is straight, seems crooked through the water:<br />
But I, who bear my reason undisturbed,<br />
Can see this Antony, this dreaded man,<br />
A fearful slave, who fain would run away,<br />
And shuns his master's eyes: If you pursue him,<br />
My life on't, he still drags a chain along,<br />

He fears to see my face.</p>

Come, free me from Ventidius; from my tyrant:<br />

On my remembrance.&mdash;How I long for night!<br />
That both the sweets of mutual love may try,<br />
And triumph once o'er C&aelig;sar ere we die.<span class="sdr">[Exeunt.</span></p>

<h4 class="scn">ACT III. SCENE I.</h4>

<p class="sdn">At one door, enter <span class="cnm">Cleopatra, Charmion, Iras,</span>
and <span class="cnm">Alexas,</span> a Train of Egyptians: at the other,
<span class="cnm">Antony</span> and Romans. The entrance on both sides
is prepared by music; the trumpets first sounding
on <span class="cnm">Antony's</span> part: then answered by timbrels, &amp;c.
on <span class="cnm">Cleopatra's. Charmion</span> and <span class="cnm">Iras</span> hold a
laurel wreath betwixt them. A Dance of Egyptians.
After the ceremony, <span class="cnm">Cleopatra</span> crowns <span class="cnm">Antony.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> I thought how those white arms would fold me in,<br />
And strain me close, and melt me into love;<br />
So pleased with that sweet image, I sprung forwards,<br />
And added all my strength to every blow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Come to me, come, my soldier, to my arms!<br />
You've been too long away from my embraces;<br />
But, when I have you fast, and all my own,<br />
With broken murmurs, and with amorous sighs,<br />
I'll say, you were unkind, and punish you,<br />
And mark you red with many an eager kiss.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> My brighter Venus!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> O my greater Mars!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Thou join'st us well, my love!<br />
Suppose me come from the Phlegr&aelig;an plains,<br />
Where gasping giants lay, cleft by my sword,<br />
And mountain tops pared off each other blow,<br />
To bury those I slew. Receive me, goddess!<br />
Let C&aelig;sar spread his subtile nets; like Vulcan,<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_356" name="page_356"></a>
In thy embraces I would be beheld<br />
By heaven and earth at once;<br />
And make their envy what they meant their sport.<br />
Let those, who took us, blush; I would love on,<br />
With awful state, regardless of their frowns,<br />
As their superior god.<br />
There's no satiety of love in thee:<br />
Enjoyed, thou still art new; perpetual spring<br />
Is in thy arms; the ripened fruit but falls,<br />
And blossoms rise to fill its empty place;<br />
And I grow rich by giving.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Ventidius,</span> and stands apart.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alex.</span> O, now the danger's past, your general comes!<br />
He joins not in your joys, nor minds your triumphs;<br />
But, with contracted brows, looks frowning on,<br />
As envying your success.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Now, on my soul, he loves me; truly loves me:<br />
He never flattered me in any vice,<br />
But awes me with his virtue: even this minute,<br />
Methinks, he has a right of chiding me.<br />
Lead to the temple: I'll avoid his presence;<br />
It checks too strong upon me.<span class="sdr">[Exeunt the rest.</span><br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> By Hercules' father, that's yet greater,<br />
I bring you somewhat you would wish to know.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> I am waning in his favour, yet I love him;<br />
I love this man, who runs to meet his ruin;<br />
And sure the gods, like me, are fond of him;<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_357" name="page_357"></a>
His virtues lie so mingled with his crimes,<br />
As would confound their choice to punish one,<br />
And not reward the other.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Antony.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> We can conquer,<br />
You see, without your aid.<br />
We have dislodged their troops;<br />
They look on us at distance, and, like curs<br />
'Scaped from the lion's paws, they bay far off,<br />
And lick their wounds, and faintly threaten war.<br />
Five thousand Romans, with their faces upward,<br />
Lie breathless on the plain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> 'Tis well; and he,<br />
Who lost them, could have spared ten thousand more.<br />
Yet if, by this advantage, you could gain<br />
An easier peace, while C&aelig;sar doubts the chance<br />
Of arms&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> O think not on't, Ventidius!<br />
The boy pursues my ruin, he'll no peace;<br />
His malice is considerate in advantage.<br />
O, he's the coolest murderer! so staunch,<br />
He kills, and keeps his temper.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Have you no friend<br />
In all his army, who has power to move him?<br />
Mec&aelig;nas, or Agrippa, might do much.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> They're both too deep in C&aelig;sar's interests.<br />
We'll work it out by dint of sword, or perish.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Fain I would find some other.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Thank thy love.<br />
Some four or five such victories as this<br />
Will save thy farther pains.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Expect no more; C&aelig;sar is on his guard:<br />
I know, sir, you have conquered against odds;<br />
But still you draw supplies from one poor town,<br />
And of Egyptians: he has all the world,<br />
And, at his beck, nations come pouring in,<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_358" name="page_358"></a>
To fill the gaps you make. Pray, think again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Why dost thou drive me from myself, to search<br />
For foreign aids? to hunt my memory,<br />
And range all o'er a waste and barren place,<br />
To find a friend? the wretched have no friends.<br />
Yet I had one, the bravest youth of Rome,<br />
Whom C&aelig;sar loves beyond the love of women:<br />
He could resolve his mind, as fire does wax,<br />
From that hard rugged image melt him down,<br />
And mould him in what softer form he pleased.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Him would I see; that man, of all the world;<br />
Just such a one we want.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> He loved me too;<br />
I was his soul; he lived not but in me:<br />
We were so closed within each others breasts,<br />
The rivets were not found, that joined us first.<br />
That does not reach us yet: we were so mixt,<br />
As meeting streams, both to ourselves were lost;<br />
We were one mass; we could not give or take,<br />
But from the same; for he was I, I he.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> He moves as I would wish him.<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> After this,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> No matter where,<br />
Since he's no longer mine. He took unkindly,<br />
That I forbade him Cleopatra's sight,<br />
Because I feared he loved her: he confest,<br />
He had a warmth, which, for my sake, he stifled;<br />
For 'twere impossible that two, so one,<br />
Should not have loved the same. When he departed,<br />
He took no leave; and that confirmed my thoughts.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> It argues, that he loved you more than her,<br />
Else he had staid; but he perceived you jealous,<br />
And would not grieve his friend: I know he loves you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Perhaps<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Would you believe he loved you?<br />
I read your answer in your eyes, you would.<br />
Not to conceal it longer, he has sent<br />

Art thou returned at last, my better half?<br />

Let me not live,<br />
If the young bridegroom, longing for his night,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> I must be silent, for my soul is busy<br />
About a noble work: she's new come home,<br />
Like a long-absent man, and wanders o'er<br />
Each room, a stranger to her own, to look<br />
If all be safe.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Thou hast what's left of me;<br />
For I am now so sunk from what I was,<br />
Thou find'st me at my lowest water-mark.<br />
The rivers that ran in, and raised my fortunes,<br />
Are all dried up, or take another course:<br />
What I have left is from my native spring;<br />
I've still a heart that swells, in scorn of fate,<br />
And lifts me to my banks.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> Still you are lord of all the world to me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Why, then I yet am so; for thou art all.<br />
If I had any joy when thou wert absent,<br />
I grudged it to myself; methought I robbed<br />
Thee of thy part. But, oh, my Dolabella!<br />
Thou hast beheld me other than I am.<br />
Hast thou not seen my morning chambers filled<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_360" name="page_360"></a>
With sceptered slaves, who waited to salute me?<br />
With eastern monarchs, who forgot the sun,<br />
To worship my uprising? menial kings<br />
Ran coursing up and down my palace-yard,<br />
Stood silent in my presence, watched my eyes,<br />
And, at my least command, all started out,<br />
Like racers to the goal<a class="ftnt" href="#All_4-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> Yes; when his end is so, I must join with him;<br />
Indeed I must, and yet you must not chide:<br />
Why am I else your friend?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Take heed, young man,<br />
How thou upbraid'st my love: The queen has eyes,<br />
And thou too hast a soul. Canst thou remember,<br />
When, swelled with hatred, thou beheld'st her first<br />
As accessary to thy brother's death?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> Spare my remembrance; 'twas a guilty day,<br />
And still the blush hangs here.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> To clear herself,<br />
For sending him no aid, she came from Egypt.<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_361" name="page_361"></a>
Her galley down the silver Cydnos rowed,<br />
The tackling silk, the streamers waved with gold;<br />
The gentle winds were lodged in purple sails:<br />
Her nymphs, like Nereids, round her couch were placed;<br />
Where she, another sea-born Venus, lay.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> No more: I would not hear it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> O, you must!<br />
She lay, and leant her cheek upon her hand,<br />
And cast a look so languishingly sweet,<br />
As if, secure of all beholders' hearts,<br />
Neglecting, she could take them: boys, like Cupids,<br />
Stood fanning, with their painted wings, the winds,<br />
That played about her face: but if she smiled,<br />
A darting glory seemed to blaze abroad,<br />
That men's desiring eyes were never wearied,<br />
But hung upon the object: To soft flutes<br />
The silver oars kept time; and while they played,<br />
The hearing gave new pleasure to the sight;<br />
And both to thought. 'Twas heaven, or somewhat more:<br />
For she so charmed all hearts, that gazing crowds<br />
Stood panting on the shore, and wanted breath<br />
To give their welcome voice.<br />
Then, Dolabella, where was then thy soul?<br />
Was not thy fury quite disarmed with wonder?<br />
Didst thou not shrink behind me from those eyes<br />
And whisper in my ear,&mdash;Oh, tell her not<br />
That I accused her of my brother's death?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> And should my weakness be a plea for yours?<br />
Mine was an age when love might be excused,<br />
When kindly warmth, and when my springing youth<br />
Made it a debt to nature. Yours&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Speak boldly.<br />
Yours, he would say, in your declining age,<br />
When no more heat was left but what you forced,<br />
When all the sap was needful for the trunk,<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_362" name="page_362"></a>
When it went down, then you constrained the course,<br />
And robbed from nature, to supply desire;<br />
In you (I would not use so harsh a word)<br />
'Tis but plain dotage.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Ha!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> 'Twas urged too home.&mdash;<br />
But yet the loss was private, that I made;<br />
'Twas but myself I lost: I lost no legions;<br />
I had no world to lose, no people's love.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> This from a friend?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> Yes, Antony, a true one;<br />
A friend so tender, that each word I speak<br />
Stabs my own heart, before it reach your ear.<br />
O, judge me not less kind, because I chide!<br />
To C&aelig;sar I excuse you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Are they noble?<br />
Methinks thou shouldst not bring them else; yet he<br />
Is full of deep dissembling; knows no honour<br />
Divided from his interest. Fate mistook him;<br />
For nature meant him for an usurer:<br />
He's fit indeed to buy, not conquer kingdoms.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Then, granting this,<br />
What power was theirs, who wrought so hard a temper<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> It was my Dolabella, or some god.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dola.</span> Not I; nor yet Mec&aelig;nas, nor Agrippa:<br />

The business of my angry hours is done.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> C&aelig;sar is at your gates.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Why, let him enter;<br />
He's welcome now.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> What lethargy has crept into your soul?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> 'Tis but a scorn of life, and just desire<br />
To free myself from bondage.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Do it bravely.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> I will; but not by fighting. O, Ventidius!<br />
What should I fight for now? my queen is dead.<br />
I was but great for her; my power, my empire,<br />
Were but my merchandise to buy her love;<br />
And conquered kings, my factors. Now she's dead,<br />
Let C&aelig;sar, take the world,&mdash;<br />
An empty circle, since the jewel's gone<br />
Which made it worth my strife: my being's nauseous;<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_402" name="page_402"></a>
For all the bribes of life are gone away.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Would you be taken?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Yes, I would be taken;<br />
But, as a Roman ought,&mdash;dead, my Ventidius:<br />
For I'll convey my soul from C&aelig;sar's reach,<br />
And lay down life myself. 'Tis time the world<br />
Should have a lord, and know whom to obey.<br />
We two have kept its homage in suspence,<br />
And bent the globe, on whose each side we trod,<br />
Till it was dented inwards. Let him walk<br />
Alone upon't: I'm weary of my part.<br />
My torch is out; and the world stands before me,<br />
Like a black desert at the approach of night:<br />
I'll lay me down, and stray no farther on.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> I could be grieved,<br />
But that I'll not out-live you: chuse your death;<br />
For, I have seen him in such various shapes,<br />
I care not which I take: I'm only troubled,<br />
The life I bear is worn to such a rag,<br />
'Tis scarce worth giving. I could wish, indeed,<br />
We threw it from us with a better grace;<br />
That, like two lions taken in the toils,<br />
We might at last thrust out our paws, and wound<br />
The hunters that inclose us.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> I have thought on it.<br />
Ventidius, you must live.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> I must not, sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Wilt thou not live, to speak some good of me?<br />
To stand by my fair fame, and guard the approaches<br />
From the ill tongues of men?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Who shall guard mine,<br />
For living after you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Say, I command it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> If we die well, our deaths will speak themselves,<br />
And need no living witness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Thou hast loved me,<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_403" name="page_403"></a>
And fain I would reward thee. I must die;<br />
Kill me, and take the merit of my death,<br />
To make thee friends with C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Thank your kindness.<br />
You said I loved you; and, in recompence,<br />
You bid me turn a traitor:&mdash;Did I think<br />
You would have used me thus? that I should die<br />
With a hard thought of you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Forgive me, Roman.<br />
Since I have heard of Cleopatra's death,<br />
My reason bears no rule upon my tongue,<br />
But lets my thoughts break all at random out.<br />
I've thought better; do not deny me twice.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> By heaven I will not.<br />
Let it not be to out-live you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Kill me first,<br />
And then die thou; for 'tis but just thou serve<br />
Thy friend, before thyself.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Give me your hand.<br />
We soon shall meet again. Now, farewell, emperor!&mdash;<span class="sdr">[Embrace.</span><br />
Methinks that word's too cold to be my last:<br />
Since death sweeps all distinctions, farewell, friend!<br />
That's all&mdash;<br />
I will not make a business of a trifle:<br />
And yet I cannot look on you, and kill you;<br />
Pray turn your face.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> I do: strike home, be sure.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> Home, as my sword will reach.<span class="sdr">[Kills himself.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> O thou mistak'st;<br />
That wound was none of thine: give it me back:<br />
Thou robb'st me of my death.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Vent.</span> I do indeed;<br />
But think 'tis the first time I e'er deceived you,<br />
If that may plead my pardon.&mdash;And you, gods,<br />
Forgive me, if you will; for I die perjured,<br />
Rather than kill my friend.<span class="sdr">[Dies.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><a class="pgnm" id="page_404" name="page_404"></a>
<span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Farewell! Ever my leader, even in death!<br />
My queen and thou have got the start of me,<br />
And I'm the lag of honour.&mdash;Gone so soon?<br />
Is death no more? he used him carelessly,<br />
With a familiar kindness: ere he knocked,<br />
Ran to the door, and took him in his arms,<br />
As who should say&mdash;You're welcome at all hours,<br />
A friend need give no warning. Books had spoiled him;<br />
For all the learned are cowards by profession.<br />
'Tis not worth<br />
My farther thought; for death, for aught I know,<br />
Is but to think no more. Here's to be satisfied.
<span class="sdr">[Falls on his sword.</span><br />
I've mist my heart. O unperforming hand!<br />
Thou never could'st have erred in a worse time.<br />
My fortune jades me to the last; and death,<br />
Like a great man, takes state, and makes me wait<br />
For my admittance.&mdash;<span class="sdr">[Trampling within.</span><br />
Some, perhaps, from C&aelig;sar:<br />
If he should find me living, and suspect<br />
That I played booty with my life! I'll mend<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Char.</span> There he lies,<br />

We live both. Sit thee down, my Cleopatra:<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_405" name="page_405"></a>
I'll make the most I can of life, to stay<br />
A moment more with thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> How is it with you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> 'Tis as with a man<br />
Removing in a hurry; all packed up,<br />
But one dear jewel that his haste forgot;<br />
And he, for that, returns upon the spur:<br />
So I come back for thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Too long, ye heavens, you have been cruel to me:<br />
Now show your mended faith, and give me back<br />
His fleeting life!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> It will not be, my love;<br />
I keep my soul by force.<br />
Say but, thou art not false.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> 'Tis now too late<br />
To say I'm true: I'll prove it, and die with you.<br />
Unknown to me, Alexas feigned my death:<br />
Which, when I knew, I hasted to prevent<br />
This fatal consequence. My fleet betrayed<br />
Both you and me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> And Dolabella&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Scarce esteemed before he loved; but hated now.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Enough: my life's not long enough for more.<br />
Thou say'st, thou wilt come after: I believe thee;<br />
For I can now believe whate'er thou sayest,<br />
That we may part more kindly.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> I will come:<br />
Doubt not, my life, I'll come, and quickly too:<br />
C&aelig;sar shall triumph o'er no part of thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> But grieve not, while thou stayest,<br />
My last disastrous times:<br />
Think we have had a clear and glorious day;<br />
And heaven did kindly to delay the storm,<br />
Just till our close of evening. Ten years love,<br />
And not a moment lost, but all improved<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_406" name="page_406"></a>
To the utmost joys,&mdash;what ages have we liv'd?<br />
And now to die each others; and, so dying,<br />
While hand in hand we walk in groves below,<br />
Whole troops of lovers' ghosts shall flock about us,<br />
And all the train be ours.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Your words are like the notes of dying swans,<br />
Too sweet to last. Were there so many hours<br />
For your unkindness, and not one for love?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> No, not a minute.&mdash;This one kiss&mdash;more worth<br />
Than all I leave to C&aelig;sar.<span class="sdr">[Dies.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> O, tell me so again,<br />
And take ten thousand kisses for that word.<br />
My lord, my lord! speak, if you yet have being;<br />
Sign to me, if you cannot speak; or cast<br />
One look! Do any thing, that shows you live.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Iras.</span> He's gone too far to hear you;<br />
And this you see, a lump of senseless clay,<br />
The leavings of a soul.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Char.</span> Remember, madam,<br />
He charged you not to grieve.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> And I'll obey him.<br />
I have not loved a Roman, not to know<br />
What should become his wife; his wife, my Charmion!<br />
For 'tis to that high title I aspire;<br />
And now I'll not die less. Let dull Octavia<br />
Survive, to mourn him dead: My nobler fate<br />
Shall knit our spousals with a tie, too strong<br />
For Roman laws to break.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Iras.</span> Will you then die?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Why should'st thou make that question?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Iras.</span> C&aelig;sar is most merciful.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Let him be so<br />
To those that want his mercy: My poor lord<br />
Made no such covenant with him, to spare me<br />
When he was dead. Yield me to C&aelig;sar's pride?<br />
What! to be led in triumph through the streets,<br />
A spectacle to base plebeian eyes;<br />
<a class="pgnm" id="page_407" name="page_407"></a>
While some dejected friend of Antony's,<br />
Close in a corner, shakes his head, and mutters<br />
A secret curse on her, who ruined him!<br />
I'll none of that.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Char.</span> Whatever you resolve,<br />
I'll follow, even to death.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Iras.</span> I only feared<br />
For you; but more should fear to live without you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Why, now, 'tis as it should be. Quick, my friends,<br />
Despatch; ere this, the town's in C&aelig;sar's hands:<br />
My lord looks down concerned, and fears my stay,<br />
Lest I should be surprised;<br />
Keep him not waiting for his love too long.<br />
You, Charmion, bring my crown and richest jewels;<br />
With them, the wreath of victory I made<br />
(Vain augury!) for him, who now lies dead:<br />
You, Iras, bring the cure of all our ills.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Iras.</span> The aspicks, madam?</p>

He is not frightful, sure.<br />
We're now alone, in secresy and silence;<br />
And is not this like lovers? I may kiss<br />
These pale, cold lips; Octavia does not see me:<br />
And, oh! 'tis better far to have him thus,<br />
Than see him in her arms.&mdash;O welcome, welcome!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Short ceremony, friends;<br />
But yet it must be decent. First, this laurel<br />

These ensigns of your pomp and royalty?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Dull, that thou art! why,'tis to meet my love;<br />
As when I saw him first, on Cydnos' bank,<br />
All sparkling, like a goddess: so adorned,<br />
I'll find him once again; my second spousals<br />
Shall match my first in glory. Haste, haste, both,<br />
And dress the bride of Antony.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Char.</span> 'Tis done.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cleo.</span> Now seat me by my lord. I claim this place;<br />

O let no impious hand remove you hence;<br />

<p>Poets, like disputants, when reasons fail,</p>

<p>For our poor wretch, he neither rails nor prays;</p>
<p>Nor likes your wit just as you like his plays;</p>
<p>He has not yet so much of Mr Bayes.</p>
<p>He does his best; and if he cannot please,</p>
<p>Would quietly sue out his <i>writ of ease</i>.</p>
<p>Yet, if he might his own grand jury call,</p>
<p>By the fair sex he begs to stand or fall.</p>
<p>Let C&aelig;sar's power the men's ambition move,</p>
<p>But grace you him, who lost the world for love!</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
